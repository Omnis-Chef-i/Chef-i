They used croutons instead of the slice of bread.\n\nI had a chicken sandwich with micro greens and cheese and avacado. The cheese could have been a little more melted on the sandwich but this is totally nitpicking.\n\nEverything tasted great and the service was quick and friendly. Very locals only vibe. The bartender knew her clients kids and asked them about how they are. This is what it’s about. I’d come back.",

We had beautiful weather and got lucky that they sat us in the patio. The atmosphere was super chill and beautiful. The wings were delicious and crispy and the mozzarella sticks were good. Definitely our top 5 wing spot in Buffalo!",

They recommended Gabriel's gate as a local favorite as opposed to the hyped up one.  The wings were good.  We got mild spice.  Their blue cheese burger was a bit dry considering I ordered it cook medium.  Wifey had a cheese steak sandwich and it was very good.  Especially the next day with a light nuke in the microwave.   The server was fabulously helpful and friendly.  Place was super busy and everyone really seemed to be enjoying the vibe of the place.

I was worried about going with young kids who are picky eaters (9 and 7)  The food looked and tasted amazing, the vibe was relaxed and welcoming, and everyone was super friendly. It’s also really kid-friendly — our kids can be tough to please, but they were obsessed. The server even gave them kid chopsticks, which they thought was the coolest thing ever.\n\nThe food was awesome all around:\n\n•Yakitori– tender with a really good sauce. You could tell it was fresh.\n\n•Teriyaki chicken– soft, flavorful, and the rice was perfect.\n\n•Gyoza – veggie dumplings with great texture.\n\n•Maki rolls– California and shrimp tempura rolls were both hits. We also tried the salmon avocado and cucumber avocado!\n\n•Yuzu dessert– light, fluffy, and just the right hint of lemon and blueberry. I was really impressed with the flavor and texture and wished the slice was a bit bigger it was so good. We don’t usually eat dessert so that’s saying something.\n\n•Matcha pudding-  not our thing, but if you’re into matcha, and not so sweet dessert you’ll love it.\n\nWe’d 100% come back. The kids were already telling our waitress that next time we’re in NYC, **this is the first place we’re going**. Couldn’t have asked for a better dinner with my boys.",

Our server was attentive and pleasant, accommodating each of our requests. Our party tried the strawberry daiquiri, the coconut daiquiri, and the mango. Each one was equally delicious, though my preference is the strawberry. We all ordered the birria chimichangas and they were absolutely phenomenal, and even better the next day. The refried beans were great unlike any I’ve ever had, definitely a must try! We saw some birthday celebrations for other guests, which was awesome. Our server even helped us take some photos before we left. I highly recommend this restaurant for a laid back, chill vibe.",

I ordered steak/shrimp fajitas (choose up to 3 proteins) and the portion was huge but came with only 2 tortillas??  I asked for more, they charged me $1 for 2 more which is fine I guess but it still wasn't enough tortillas for the amount of fajitas.   My margarita was very good and the atmosphere was great",

    "text": "Easily one of the best restaurants in Saratoga. The Smashburger was delicious and full of flavor. It came on time and I was not disappointed.\n\nMy wife thoroughly enjoyed the chicken and waffles. It was all white meat chicken breast. Crispy and flavorful. I took a few bites and I was envious but I also enjoyed my burger. It just makes you want a little bit of everything.\n\nWe got the picture of Bellini and it was perfect for both of us. Great value.\n\nOverall, we will return very soon.\n\nWe went for brunch around 3 PM on a Sunday and it wasn’t too busy. Granted we had a reservation so if you have the opportunity make a reservation and you won’t be disappointed. Worst case you’ll have a 10 to 15 minute wait",

We tried a range of dishes—Bun Bo Hue, Pho with brisket, half chicken dinner, ginger salmon with rice, beef and spring roll vermicelli, and chicken curry with rice—and everything was delicious.\n\nThe Bun Bo Hue had the perfect level of spice, just how I like it. The half chicken dinner was a pleasant surprise—moist and flavorful, and it’s the first time I’ve seen it offered at a Vietnamese restaurant. The beef and spring roll vermicelli was spot on, with the beef having a jerky-like texture that made the dish even better. The Pho was comforting and well-balanced.\n\nOne thing that stood out was the fish sauce served with the dishes—it had a unique twist. It wasn’t the usual sweet variety, and while I couldn’t quite figure out the ingredients (maybe apple cider vinegar?), it was delicious.\n\nIf you’re craving authentic and flavorful Vietnamese food, Saigon Spring is a must-visit. We’ll definitely be coming back again when we’re back in the area",

    "text": "My wife had an amazing meal here a couple of months ago and has been wanting to bring me since. Schenectady has no shortage of amazing Italian restaurants so the bar was set pretty high.\n\nThe impression you get when you walk in is that not much has changed since the 1960s! The small bar is easily imagined with old friends and cigarette smoke after all hard days work. The restaurant is fairly small and it was crowded and somewhat noisy but that is certainly understandable on a Saturday night. We were seated in about 15 minutes having made a reservation.\n\nThe service was great even though they were obviously overwhelmed. The menu was full of southern and Northern Italian dishes, including things like a red, roasted pepper and provolone appetizer. You don’t see that on many menus. We were probably presented with a basket of bread which tasted like it came from Perreca’s. There was butter and no dipping oil. There is a lovely cocktail selection each very unusual and two of us went for the.Revello, which is blood, orange gin, Cointreau, orange juice, and club soda. It was great, even though a bit strong for my taste.  The salad was served family style, which was a lovely touch. Amazingly fresh with lettuce, tomato, celery, black olives, and small cubes of provolone. Served with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing wonderful.\n\nThe first issue is that our entrées came out too soon. It’s an unusual complaint but when you are enjoying a salad like that and may want to have seconds out of the big bowl, it’s nice to have a little bit of time. That being said as busy as it was, I’m not sure they had the luxury of optimal timing.\n\nAs for entrées, one of us had chicken francese, reported as being wonderful. The eggplant Parmesan, likewise, and it was lightly fried or sautéed, and did not have a breading on it. I should report that the portions are very large. I had the seafood platter, which is more like a.zuppa de pesce, which I had in red sauce, but you can have in white sauce as well, which contained a huge amount of clams shrimp calamari scallops. The shrimp were large 16/20 or possibly larger.\n\nThe one food issue of the night is the haddock piccata. When my wife first ate here, she found this dish to be amazing and brought some home and I agreed. What made it amazing is it had a very light coating and was sautéed. The coding seemed like just egg and flour. The haddock piccata we had last night was deep fried with a thick breading. It totally took away from the dish, and the breading prevented the sauce from mixing with the fish. I’m not sure if it’s a difference between chefs, but if they read this, I hope they go back to the prior preparation. We did not try the homemade pasta, but it is available as an up charge.\n\nWe left full and happy and will be back. We were in no shape for dessert although I’m sure it is amazing.",

Somethings remain the same; on street parking is hit or miss – this time the parking deity shined upon us with a spot near their front door – with the one person entrance step into their small yet comfortable bar. The bar is the dining room entrance. Ferrari’s dining room was nicely updated and well lighted. All their tables filled quickly.\n\nOur ample broccoli rabe appetizer had the perfect balance of olive oil and garlic that was cooked to tender perfection. A bottle of il Principe Nebbiolo was the ideal wine for our entire meal. It was smooth and flavorful, quite frankly it slid down way too fast.\nA sizable eggplant parmigiano, with an equally huge spaghetti side, was tender, flavorful and perfectly breaded and prepared. My linguini with clam sauce took a while to decipher on their menu. The preferred white clam sauce was one of several offered. When presented it was spot on. A mound of al dente, linguini with tender, sliced garlic and a dozen clams in their shells. The clams were sumptuous, quickly shelled and mixed into the linguini.\n\nA tartufo, presented with a sizable soup spoon, was cracked and enjoyed by all.\n\nOur leftovers, substantial, were enjoyed the next few nights.\nIt was comforting to know that Ferrari’s maintained its high standards and service.",

    "text": "SHMONÉ NY. A True Culinary Experience, Not Just a Meal\n\nWhat an incredible night! My friend told me SHMONÉ was amazing, so we decided to walk in and grab two seats at the bar. Best decision ever. From the moment we sat down, the staff made us feel like regulars. Everyone was super friendly, professional and clearly passionate about what they do.\n\nThe open kitchen setup is something special, it feels like you’re part of the show. The chef himself came over to chat with us, explained the specials and even served a few dishes directly from the kitchen to the bar. You can see and taste the creativity and care that goes into every plate.\n\nWe had several small plates, each one beautifully presented and full of flavor. The fig salad was refreshing and perfectly balanced, the meat skewer was juicy and smoky, and the short rib absolutely unreal, melt- n your mouth good. Every dish looked like a piece of art.\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy, elegant and energetic the kind of spot where you lose track of time and just enjoy great food, drinks, and conversation.\n\nMust-try: The short rib and the chef’s seasonal specials.\nPro tip: Sit at the bar if you can — you’ll get the full SHMONÉ experience.\n\nA memorable dining experience from start to finish. Can’t wait to come back!",

The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming, with great music that sets the mood just right.\n\nWhen we arrived, our table wasn’t ready yet, but the host was incredibly kind and suggested we wait at the wine bar next door. We were warmly welcomed there, had a lovely drink, and honestly didn’t mind the wait at all.\n\nOur server Anya was absolutely fantastic — knowledgeable, attentive, and full of warmth. She could tell us about every dish and drink in detail and made the whole evening feel special.\n\nThe open kitchen is beautiful to look at, and it’s genuinely fun to watch the chefs work — the whole team is impressive.\n\nAs for the food: everything was spot on. Our favorites were the tuna, grilled vegetables, beef rib, sweetbreads, and the lamb kebab. All were must-tries.\n\nShmone isn’t flashy or over-the-top — it’s the kind of place you want to keep coming back to. I only wish I’d discovered it sooner. Already planning my next visit.",

    "text": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nLast night at SHMONÉ felt like one of those perfect New York nights you wish you could replay again and again. We walked in early, thinking we’d just grab a quick dinner… and then four hours later, we were still sitting at the bar, eating, laughing, drinking, and watching this wild kitchen ballet happening right in front of us.\n\n🔥 We had front-row seats — chefs flying, pans sizzling, olive oil dripping like gold. You could feel the energy. Everyone’s working hard but smiling, throwing jokes around, pouring martinis, and making it all look effortless.\n\n🥯 We started with that famous Jerusalem bagel — warm, fluffy, olive oil and za’atar dripping off the edges — honestly, I could’ve stopped right there and called it a night. But then came the tuna, so fresh it practically winked at us, and the octopus, smoky and soft with those beans… unreal.\n\n😋 The sweetbreads hit the table next — I don’t even know how to explain it — crispy, tangy, creamy, somehow a salad but not really a salad. The pistachio pesto pasta was so good we stopped talking for five minutes.\n\n🥩 And then the 76-layer Wagyu. Oh my God. The waiter brought us challah after and said, “you’ll need this to soak up the juice,” and he was absolutely right — we cleaned that plate like it was the last supper.\n\n🍷 Between bites and martinis, we kept saying, “just one more dish,” but we didn’t want to leave. Everything was shareable, everything was perfect, and every bite was better than the last.\n\nMust-haves: 🥩 Beef short rib ❤️ Sweetbreads 🐙 Octopus 🐟 Tuna 🥯 Jerusalem bagel\n\nIf I could move in and sit at that bar every night, I would. This isn’t just dinner — it’s a whole New York moment. SHMONÉ, you got me. I’m hooked.",

While the atmosphere was lively and the open kitchen concept is a nice touch, the food was disappointing—overpowered by salt and spices, lacking balance and nuance. Service also felt inattentive at times, which affected the overall experience. It wasn’t a terrible evening, but for the price point, I expected something more refined, thoughtful, and consistent.",

The soy vinaigrette was sweet and thick which I liked.\n\nLastly , I got the basil sauce .

We were worried and hungry, and came across this local Thai restaurant with many good reviews. We decided to try it, and it turned out to be such a wonderful experience.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious and authentic, the service was warm and attentive, and the background music was gentle and calming—just what we needed to ease our anxious hearts. By the end of our meal, we received a call from the surgeon telling us that our mom’s surgery was a great success.\n\nThis dinner brought comfort and joy to us on such a stressful day.

I was looking for a sophisticated but reasonable happy hour venue with my husband and found this lovely place that has recently opened in our neighborhood. During the day they are a charming coffee shop and in the early evening they convert to a wine bar with delicious Georgian appetizers and entrees. Standouts are the traditional Khachapuri cheese bread, Boquerones en Vinagre with Oven-baked Potatoes (marinated anchovies with potatoes), and a lovely selection of organic and natural low impact wines from Georgia, Moravian wine from the Czech Republic as well as  wines from more familiar regions including France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain and the US. The food photos are a little haphazard, as we were voraciously eating our food before remembering to take pictures first, but hopefully they accurately represent the fare. Of note, the entire kitchen is behind the bar so you can watch the food alchemy that is occurring right before your eyes by the experienced and congenial team. We will definitely be back to enjoy their dinner menu for my birthday - if not before!",

They were pricey but that’s expected in the city. We picked a bunch to have a full on family style meal. We ordered the roti canai, roti telur, ilat bakar (fish), duck curry, Singapore crispy soft shell chili crab, baby bok choi, Hainanese roast chicken with rice, Malaysian curry with shrimp and side of bao buns. The dishes started coming out one after another within short intervals. All the dishes were so amazing, huge portions, full of flavors. My favorite were the chili crab, duck, roti canai and the Thai iced tea. All of us were belly full as we throughly enjoyed all the dishes.

I mean… it’s okay to wait till the scheduled time; but it makes no sense at all waiting extra 20min past the reservation. This just tells how badly the restaurant is managed.\n\nAnd so do the foods.\n\nThe foods are terrible. Soft shell crab and the signature noodles are just way too sour, no other flavors, just being sour like chewing a lemon. Cocktails are plain as sweet water.\n\nI don’t know how you guys rate 5 stars for this place……can we be real?",

Packed with people from everywhere. It is busy so expect a line outside and inside. If you want full service with almost no wait, walk to the back. But half the fun is joining the organized chaos and doing it the classic way.\n\nMy server was amazing. He let me taste different meats before deciding and that small gesture made my day. I tipped him twenty dollars because he deserved it and he genuinely appreciated it.\n\nThe pastrami and corned beef are next level. The pastrami is the star for me. Juicy and full of flavor. If you prefer something a bit less spiced, go for the corned beef. You cannot go wrong with either. It was so crowded that there were no open seats so we invited a couple of strangers to join our table. Ended up having a great time. People from all over the country and the world all enjoying the same beautiful meal.\n\nThe coleslaw was fresh and delicious. The fries were solid and hit the spot. The portions are generous and the value is incredible. There is a reason they have tens of thousands of reviews.\n\nIf you are in New York, Katz’s is a must. The food is fantastic and the experience is unforgettable. It is truly a unique place.",

Also, even if you are not sitting down for waiter-service, you have to tip a few dollars to EACH station (cutters, sides & drinks) - now that is a $35-40 sandwich.\n\nHighlights are the fast service each respective station (cutters and sides/drinks). The line from around the block to inside moved reasonably quick and all-in-all, perhaps a 25-30min wait on a Saturday evening.\n\nThe pastrami sandwich itself….maybe I’m just not a fan of deli-style pastrami cuts, but it just seemed dry versus a BBQ-style pastrami.\n\nSeating was first come-first served; and staff won’t really go out of their way to clean up unless you depart and they get around to it. There is a section of seating all the way back that has servers, but we seat in General dining area and shared a 4-seat table with others for a short period.",

Great pastrami sandwich and coleslaw goes well with it.\n\nEach individual must get a ticket at entrance no matter eating or not!, If ordering meat then get in any one of the ~10 lines and order your food which they make in front of you, that alone is worth 5 star to me :). Then customize right there with cheese or which spread and that is it. The cook is gonna mark your ticket before you get the food. Then go to another place for order drinks and cole slaw etc and they will mark on your ticket. Then go find a table and get in. The way they are letting people in , you will for sure get a chair but might have to share a table with a stranger, heck it's NYC so why not. I got a movie recommendation for Sisu 2 !!!.. now if you want more then get back in line and order and get your ticket marked again. Keep goin until you need to leave where you checkout and must present your ticket to get out after paying the dues cash in one corner and credit in the other corner of restaurant, heck it's NYC so you know.. forgot your ticket? Well if not ticket then pay at the least 50 bucks and some rough housing perhaps before you are let out. All in all definitely worth the expensive cost. Its a manhattan experience better then summit it WTC IMO! On the way out back to subway get your El churros with dulce caramel dip sauce from \"El churros\" and that is a nice Dinner experience all together! Have fun",

Expensive, at almost $30/sandwich, so definitely more of a luxury sandwich, but worth it. The meat was so tender and juicy, the mustard sauce was great (a little more spice would have made it perfect), and we were able to get a good seat to eat our food. There wasn’t much direction from the staff…. They gave general instructions and we had to figure out quite a bit…. What to do with the tickets, where to stand for the lines (they were more groups of people than actual lines), where to pay (we thought up front, until we got there, waited, but then learned that was cash only and cards payments were in the back of the restaurant). Same with the tickets.. the cutters put both orders on one ticket, and we used that one to pay, so we had no idea that the other was needed to exit. Had to empty our bag off to the side to retrieve it from the bottom. All in all, a delicious, though not seamless experience. Will return ready to navigate this deli adventure.",

I ordered the legendary pastrami sandwich, a matzo ball soup and a side of half sour pickles and every bite felt like stepping back into New York’s golden era.\nThe pastrami is juicy, smoky, perfectly spiced and piled sky high between slices of fresh rye bread. The soup is comforting, with a fluffy matzo ball that melts into the rich broth.\n\nYes, it’s busy but that’s part of the magic. Watching the carvers hand slice steaming pastrami behind the counter while neon lights glow and the crowd buzzes with energy is an unforgettable NYC experience.\n\nI finished everything to the last bite worth every penny and every minute in line. Katz’s isn’t just food it’s a New York institution since 1888.\n\nMust try: Pastrami on rye with mustard, matzo ball soup and pickles.\nTip: Keep your yellow ticket safe, find a seat after ordering, and just enjoy the show.\n\nUpdate: The team was super kind to reply! I’ll be back for another sandwich next time for sure… 🍞💛",

My sister and I I enjoyed a drink similar to a margarita (forgot the name), which was also good. As an entree, my wife ordered the enecebollado de pescado (fish soup made of tuna), which she loved. I tried it and loved it too. It was filling and she brought home the leftovers. I had la bandera, which was good, but not mind blowing. The rice was great; but I thought the goat was mostly bones. I had substituted the tripe for hen, and thought that was mostly bones too. The ceviche was REALLY good. For dessert, we ordered the flan and chocolate mousse. The flan was very bland, but the chocolate mousse was great. I honestly wish I had tried the caldo de bola. We had ordered it the first time and I loved it so much. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!

While it’s not necessarily the kind of place for a long sit-down meal, its location makes it perfect for a quick pickup before heading to one of the many nearby parks.\n\nI tried the spicy poke dish and was genuinely impressed by the freshness of the ingredients. The fish and vegetables tasted like they had been prepped to order, and you can tell the team puts care into the quality of what they serve. That said, the vegetables in the poke were fairly plain—I personally would have enjoyed some pickled or marinated elements to add variety and balance to the bowl. The portion of fish wasn’t overly generous, but they were not shy with the sauces, which added a flavorful kick without overpowering the dish.\n\nService-wise, they’ve always been reliable and on time with pickup orders. On my visits, they’ve been warm and grateful, especially noticing and appreciating repeat customers—which is rare and always a nice touch in a busy city.\n\nOverall, West Side Wok is a solid neighborhood option when you’re craving fresh poke or sushi on the go. It’s convenient, friendly, and consistent—a dependable spot for a casual meal, especially if you’re planning to enjoy it outdoors.",

Unfortunately, both of us got pretty sick by the next morning.

I don't want to point any fingers, because we truelly don't know but this ended up not being a fun experience. I tried calling the restaurant to just let them know, but the line goes to voicemail.

We were a party of 7, all carnivores except for me, all drinkers except for me and my husband, and one of them is a beer connoisseur, so I learned that Pilsner, a pale lager, is the most famous Czech beer. The only option on the menu for me was a selection of salads, and I opted for one of my favorite vegetables - beetroot. Their servings are quite generous, and according to my fellow diners, the taste was impeccable. They ordered a lot of beer, and together we ordered a lot of food - salads, appetizers, mains, breads, and desserts. It's a large space, its walls covered with photos and objects of antiquity. One can definitely go around like in a museum and learn a bit about the history of Czech immigrants in New York City. If you love hearty meat dishes, exotic flavors and great beer, this place is definitely for you!",

Top options from our visit were the duck confit, red cabbage, potato pancakes, and drowned sausages. Apparently they also have brunch which also looks good.

So, dining hear again was a no brainer.. Del Frisco's it is.\n\nOur second time didn't disappoint either We ordered steaks, cocktails, appetizers and wine.\n\nFor the cocktails, she had the Passion Fruit Margarita, and I had the Whistle Pig Barrel Aged Manhattan. The cocktails were on point. Additionally, we both had a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon with our meal.\n\nFor the appetizer we went with the Thick-Cut Nueske’s Bacon and the Charred Octopus. The Bacon was excellent, smokey and delicious. The Octopus was disappointing.  It was overcooked and chewy, so we had to send that one back.\n\nFor our main courses, my wife ordered the Braised Angus Short Rib and was  later informed  that it was sold out, so she settled for the Filet Mignon, and I had the Bone-In Prime Ribeye.  For our sides we had fries, broccolini and the Classic Caesar. Oh, and not to mention, that wonderful warm bread for the table. All of the meats were cooked to perfection, the sides were great, but on a side note... the side of fries was way more then we expected. I would say was enough for 5 people.\n\nThe steak house itself has a nice sexy ambiance, but still chill enough for the fellas to grab a meal or hang at the bar.\n\nThe service was great, our waiter M.D. was very professional and attentive. He was very apologetic for the mess up on the Short Rib order and the over cooked Octopus. Even the Supervisor,  (Kristin), came over and checked on us to make sure we were good and chatted with us about the New York food scene.\n\nThank you both for a good time.",

I visited for my birthday at the recommendation of my partner’s brother, and the evening was exceptional from start to finish.\n\nThe centerpiece of our meal was a 34-ounce porterhouse, perfectly cooked to a medium-rare that balanced a charred exterior with a tender, juicy interior. The steak delivered exactly what one expects from a top-tier steakhouse, both in flavor and execution. Accompanying sides often risk being an afterthought, but here the mashed potatoes were a highlight in their own right, rich, buttery, and layered with garlic that enhanced rather than overwhelmed.\n\nFor dessert, the kitchen presented a celebratory dish that closed the meal on a high note, a thoughtful and indulgent finish to an already memorable evening.\n\nDel Frisco’s succeeds in maintaining an atmosphere that feels both refined and celebratory, making it an excellent choice for special occasions. From the quality of the steak to the details in service and presentation, it is a dining experience that justifies its reputation and one I would readily return to.",

The steaks are consistently outstanding—perfectly cooked to your preference, tender, and full of flavor. You can tell the kitchen takes pride in getting it just right every single time.\n\nOne standout for me is their crab cakes. They’re unlike any I’ve had elsewhere—perfectly seared, packed with fresh crab, and elevated with a subtle touch of Indian masala that adds just the right amount of warmth and depth without overpowering the delicate seafood. It’s a unique twist that sets them apart from the typical steakhouse appetizer.\n\nOn top of the excellent food, the service is always impeccable. The staff strikes the perfect balance between professionalism and warmth, making you feel genuinely welcomed. The atmosphere is elegant yet lively, which makes it ideal for both business dinners and special occasions.",

Upon receiving the steak it came overcooked. We ordered medium and it was more like well done. They quickly replaced the dish, even took away our side dishes to ensure we can enjoy the sides hot with our replacement steak.\n\nThe replacement quickly came as they happened to have another order of the same temperature and gave us that one instead. To my disappointment, the bone is quite small and they also wet-age their steak, which I find less flavorful.  Both the corn and the mushrooms were good, however, I find their portions are on the smaller side. With the same number of dishes ordered from my favorite steakhouse, I'd be leaving feeling fairly full and satisfied. It wasn't the case at Del Frisco's. Granted, we usually order a mashed potatoes instead but I wanted to try their corn.\n\nOverall, it was a nice dining experience. The service was good and the environment was nice.",

The weather was nice so we chose to sit outside.\n\nOur waiter was so cool and aware. He did a great job with all the customers sitting outside. I was impressed.\n\nMy hubs had a cheese burger and I opted for the hot dogs and fries. The dogs were good, but far too many onions and too much deli mustard for me. The fries were also hot and crispy.\n\nThe showstoppers were the root beer float and chocolate shake. We couldn't stop talking about them.\n\nNext time I'm in Brooklyn, I'll be making another stop for sure.",

Solid reviews and really deserves more than a 4.3 rating..come on folks, hype up your favorite spots… because this place a strong and steady flow of local New Yorkers for breakfast (especially families with young kids).\nMy breakfast sandwich, The Modern, was delicious! I was able to change the ciabatta bread to the brioche bun which was soft and sweet and the tomato bacon jam was out of this world, yummy. I’ll definitely add bacon to this sandwich next time. My partner got the steak and eggs, good sized steak, well seasoned, cooked to the desired temperature and the eggs they use here are huge and hearty! We don’t usually like shredded hash browns ( prefer breakfast potatoes) but their hash browns are pretty good with onions and peppers and again, well seasoned.\nAtmosphere is very nice, small but not cramped, clean, and the staff are wonderful; friendly and attentive without being overbearing and they seem to work well as a team to serve all customers. Overall this was a really great experience, slight dings for the fact that the coffee was pretty weak (and o don’t like strong coffee so that’s saying something), and the orange juice was a bit tart/bitter. But that aside we enjoyed it so much we ordered a salad and Cuban sandwich to-go for lunch later!\nAwesome food, great service… stop by!!",

We went for the early seating and it was relatively quiet on a rainy last day of the year.\n\nAlex, our server, was friendly and was kind enough to offer us a glass of wine on the house, after he felt bad having charged full price for our little one on the Prix Fixe menu.\n\nFood overall was pretty decent. There was a Pappardelle pasta for our little one, and a few great options for meat lovers, including a Rib-eye steak which unfortunately lacked flavor, in spite of adding their rather heavy garlic and heavy cream sauce. The lobster tail was thoroughly enjoyed by the seafood lover on our table, and was enough to knock a person out on the table next to us, who possibly had a shell fish allergy. We were glad to see the person doing fine though, towards the end of the meal. Definitely not a nice way to end the year!\n\nNoise levels were on the average end throughout our time there, and their menu and service were pretty good, definitely on the expensive end though. Will definitely visit again sometime in the near future!",

Lots of ingredients like shrimp, egg and lotus root. Beef tripe with turnip is so refreshing paired up with the chili spicy oil. The tofu wrap is so tasty. Porridge’s absolutely amazing. You can tell it’s freshly cooked and prepared with lots of time. When it comes to the sticky rice dishes, I prefer the pearl one more because it’s softer and with more kinds proteins. The other one is just so plain and rice is dry. Popular place and friendly service!",

Love the interior and spacious seating and of cause the food carts pushing around the tables for you to choose are much fun and missed, most dim sum restaurants not offer the food carts nowadays, even in Asian countries. Food are delicious generally, we enjoyed a lot on all dim sum dishes. We had brunch on a weekday and thus no wait time. However, the second want to revisit on a weekend lunch time, we had waited almost an hour downstairs outside the elevator and still so crowded. Had to change to another nearby dim sum restaurant after an hour wait. Recommend to go on weekdays or go earlier over weekends and prepare for long wait.",

The peanuts really provides a good crunchiness to the savory curry. Loved how the potato’s absorb the flavors. The pad Thai with shrimp also great, and I asked for a drink that’s not too sweet and the lemon Thai ice tea was just it.

Fresh fish, fresh fruit, fresh sauce, fresh cream, fresh presentation—insanely delicious and refreshing.\n\nThe tiger bread was some of the most exceptional bread we've ever had as well. The garlic was as buttery smooth to spread as the whipped butter itself, and was pleasantly flavorful without being overly potent.\n\nMy next course was the butternut squash rigatoni. The garnish on top was light and crisp and added that extra accent to the whole dish to round it off beautifully. My wife got the iberico pork, which was cooked to tender perfection. The broccoli mash concoction that came with it was reminiscent of broccoli rabe but basically in it's ultimate form anime-style. Crazy inventive.\n\nThe next course for me was the beer battered monkfish with risotto and was actually the best beer battered anything I've ever tasted. Superior crisp encasing that mouth melting fish. The risotto had crispy chunks in it as well and helped offset the heaviness of the fried fish like a wife offsets her husband's hard shell exterior and gives way to his heart of flesh. Speaking of, my wife got the lamb with risotto and it was yet again a perfectly tender cut of meat. It was smokey and carried a more intense flavor, which also was rounded out by the gentleness of the risotto, complimenting it on that marital level yet again.\n\nLastly, the desserts came in and ended the whole show the same way it began—with favorite-level energy. It was the solid second favorite course for both of us. Mine was the panna cotta. Yo. It went crazy. It was like a salted caramel apple cheesecake, but after finding a way to dial in each ingredient to the max before artistically laying it all out on a plate without any of the cheesecake crust. I LOVE sweet/savory, and it encapsulated that in a dessert beautifully. My wife had the chocolate cake with ice cream, and like we don't even know how to properly describe how good that one was—but here goes nothing. The cake was dark dark and rich rich from the sauce oozing on top to the moist pastry itself. The ice cream had a citrus undertone to it that balanced out the richness of the cake. Literally, yin and yang on a plate with the freshest chocolate drenched cherries on top. Good Lord, the Lord is good indeed.\n\nThe service was top notch, from the warm greetings, to the coat check in, to the menu break down, to the seamless water refilling and course transitions. We are big on omakase type meals as sushi heads, and this was up there while being a fraction of the price. There was a chill and comforting vibe to the whole restaurant as well. Take a trip here and let them take your palette on a trip it will sing praises on the whole way through. Bless.",

This place will provide you with very fine example of Netherland culinary. The place is very classy, yet cozy and perfect for a romantic dinner.  It has very open contemporary design with probably the most open kitchen that I ever seen.  Imagine that you're in the loft, the dining area just continues into the kitchen without any, even formal barrier or separation.  As for the food everything that we tried and I mean everything was simply delicious! The hamachi, gnocchi,  mushrooms everything was top notch! The dessert was equally great, especially passion Fruit- a perfect combination of taste and texture without being too sweet.  The portions on the conservative side, but were very filling and price is also very comfortable for the quality of this place.  The only advice I would have to get them their tiger bread a bit bigger.\nThe place is open just in March 2025, but already made a very recommend place if you want to have a great dining in Brooklyn.\nI would definitely come back for more.",

The pro is being able to try special wild game that many other places dont have, but also, everything but 1-2 dishes were very average and forgettable.  Overall a fun experience, but not sure if it’s worth the money.\n\nWild boar potstickers - it was good but it just tasted like a pork dumpling, nothing exciting. I would order again if it wasn’t $21 for 4 pieces.\nNew orleans turtle soup - super tasty but again, it kind of just tasted like a tomato soup with some ground beef. some crackers wouldve gone great with it to add some texture as well.\nStuffed quail - texture was perfect, outside was slightly crispy but easy to cut through. the sauce that came with it on the plate was the star. not worth $45 to me personally but defintely something to try at least once.\nVension - absolutely delicious! one of my favorites of the whole meal. our waiter gave us a little fork to get the marrow out of bone and that was the cherry on top. could have ate 3 of these plates. very savory. kind of tasted like beef stew?\nAntelope - my first time trying and I wasnt the biggest fan of the texture but the taste of the antelope with the potato and sauce was delicious. hard to explain what the taste is but at $49, defintely a fun special treat yourself dish.\nElk chops - have never tasted something like this beforr and the herb murturd crust was perfect. 2 chops for $61 but it was definitely worth it. I would order it again and kind of crazy but definitely worth the price in my opinion.\n\nAlso got the Henry Burger as my partner loves burgers and we always try to get a burger to go when we go out but it was very bland and not noteworthy. We also asked for medium but it came out more well done. Fries were crunchy and crispy!",

Inside, the high-backed booths, chrome-trimmed chairs, and laminated menus reinforce the nostalgic theme.

Music volume was well-balanced, complementing the ambiance without overpowering conversation.\n\nDrinks: 5/10\nRecommendation: Improved Pendennis Club\nThe cocktail menu is concise, presented in a simple, laminated diner-style format. Drinks leaned towards the sweeter side, lacking depth and complexity.

Seems that that doesn’t slow down business. I went on a Thursday night an hour before closing and although the space\nisn’t large, it was packed. Lots of energy. I sat at the bar and had my usual …uni and fatty tuna. Both were fabulous (although the uni was $24 each vs the $15 I usually pay at other sushi houses). Can’t say that it was better than those for the price. I had a salmon sushi and immediately noticed\nthat there were none of those white veins (the typical grain that you see normally). I’ve never seen such a uniform slice of salmon. And it was as velvety as it could be. Along with it I had the seared king salmon belly. Truly wonderful flavors along with the richness of the species. The slight char offered a nice flavorful accent. I had the salmon roe only because I’ve never seen such large beads. Not sure that the flavor was different from normal sized roe but the texture was enjoyable. Finally, I had the hijiki seaweed salad. It was unlike any seaweed I’ve had. Don’t know that I can describe it as it was a totally new flavor for me. Perhaps a little earthy. Again, hard to describe but worth the experience. Sitting at the counter where 6 chefs were actively plying their trade, I saw some very uniquely presented sushi and maki rolls that made me want to try EVERYTHING. But I didn’t. I wasn’t that hungry and I would have departed with a $300 bill just for me WITHOUT beverages. I will definitely return. It is not common to have a sushi menu absolutely replete with creative options as could be found here. Great staff too. Very attentive and informative.",

Soft, pillowy, with this sweet crackly crust on top that threw me off at first… but the savory caramelized pork filling balanced it out. Not bad, kinda grew on me. 👌🏽\n\nBut the fried dumplings… y’all. They were sweet inside. I wasn’t ready for that at all, and honestly it ruined the vibe for me 😩. Like, are sweet dumplings a traditional thing? Or did I just order wrong?\n\nIf you’ve been to Tim Ho Wan, drop your recs — what’s good here, what should I try next time?

We decided to walk around Soho while we waited as they text you when the table is ready and then you have 10 minutes to claim the table. After i put the phone in my pocket to walk around and wait, I was texted 3 minutes later to say my table was ready… but unfortunately I didn’t see the message until 15 minutes after I put my phone in my pocket. We walked back to the restaurant and we were told we could have a seat at the counter which we took.\n\nThe counter was great although the service was a little light and slow but I think that might be a theme throughout the restaurant. The restaurant was filled with young people but not super loud. The cocktail I had was good. The food was fine; not really remarkable compared to any other Thai restaurants throughout the city that can easily book reservations. I would not recommend the fries everyone talks about. The decor of the restaurant was cool.\n\nI’m glad I went, but I probably wouldn’t go back unless someone else initiated the meal.",

This was actually our second try if you want to get seated right away, come early. Otherwise, the wait can be up to 2 hours. This time we got lucky and didn't wait too long.\nThe restaurant is cute, but it's small and seating is limited. We tried quite a few dishes such as\nUncle Boon's Crab Fried Rice, coconut chicken thailandese, thai tea babka french toast, disco fries,  Pha Thai with Crispy Fried Chicken, Crispy Eggplant Maytinee, Rooibos and Chrysanthemum Tea.\nOur favorites were the roti, crispy fried chicken, eggplant, and the fried rice. The disco fries were also really good. The Phat Thai was decent, but had a too much peanut for my taste. The babka French toast was a miss for me it was too dry and the spread had an odd flavor.\nOverall, it's a cool spot to check out if you're into Thai food and don't mind a wait. There are definitely other great Thai places around too, especially if you're short on time. Staff were nice but understandable can be very busy.",

Stepping into the restaurant and speaking with the owner, Jade, is like stepping back into a time from when I was younger, before every restaurant was filled with gimmicks or aesthetics and portions were meant to fill you up. It's always nice to support small businesses in these times and especially when the owners are as kind as this one.\n\nI had never gotten Filipino food before and did not think I could ever have it as a vegan. I'm glad that this restaurant offers some authentic Filipino food (I had the adobo). For those who may want something different, they also have a wide variety of other foods and desserts. Their wings are some of the best vegan wings I've had. Also for those who don't know, these are the wings that were featured on the Hot Ones with Ariana Grande (the barbecue wings are great). They also offer a Hot Ones challenge for those who want to try some spice.\n\nHaving been here for 31 years, Red Bamboo deserves more attention. I'd highly recommend checking it out. I think it deserves a spot as a vegan staple in NYC amongst the many others.",

The atmosphere is cozy, charming, and genuinely Japanese — it truly transports you.\n\nWhat really stood out, beyond the incredible food, was how honest and reasonable the pricing is. In a neighborhood where most restaurants are constantly raising prices, this place feels refreshingly grounded. We later learned the owner is from Osaka and has been running this restaurant for nearly 30 years — no wonder it feels so real.\n\nWe’ll definitely be back regularly.

Anyway, I had some miso and split the Sushi & Sashimi for two with my dad. Not cheap, but well worth it for the quality, plus they don't skimp on the serving size. The fish was so good. Oh my god. The salmon?? The MACKEREL??? Probably added at least ten years to my life. Exceptional quality, the rolls too, all of it. All the staff were wonderful, they all said goodnight when we left. 10000/10.

You can tell they’re working really hard and doing their best to keep up, and I really appreciated their good energy. I even had some nice conversations with them while waiting.\n\nThat being said, I did notice the service was very slow. I waited about 45-55 minutes just for my order to start, and overall it ended up being over an hour. The young lady working was juggling so much at once — taking orders, running food, and even making drinks. It looked like way too much for one person to handle, and I felt bad because she really was trying her best.\n\nAs for the food, it wasn’t exactly my taste, but I know everyone has different preferences, so I’ll leave that part up to others to judge.\n\nOverall, I’m not upset — I just wanted to share my honest feedback. From what I saw, this place could really shine if they had more help for the staff. The employees are wonderful, but they definitely need more support.",

The energy of the place is just as memorable as the food, and together they create such a standout dining experience.\n\nWe started with the hummus, and it was absolutely outstanding—so fresh, silky smooth, and bursting with flavor. It paired beautifully with the warm bread and set the tone for the rest of the meal. The fries and sweet potato fries deserve a special mention too: perfectly crispy, piping hot, and honestly addictive. They’re the kind of sides you keep reaching for long after you’re full.\n\nFor mains, the lamb shawarma was excellent, with a distinctly gamey flavor that made it rich and satisfying without being overpowering. It felt authentic and hearty. But one of my favorite parts of the meal was the Israeli chopped salad on tahini. It was bright, refreshing, and balanced, with that creamy tahini base tying everything together beautifully. It was light yet flavorful, the kind of dish you could eat every day and never get tired of.\n\nEverything about Shoo Shoo—from the fresh, flavorful food to the great ambiance and attentive service—makes it a place I can’t wait to return to. It’s perfect whether you’re coming for a casual meal, a night out with friends, or just to enjoy really well-executed Mediterranean dishes in a space that feels good to be in.",

It feels like the food is organically cooked, with good attention to detail, making for a very good presentation and experience.\n\nI got the beef blood sausage, and DjonDjon paella. Blood sausage was nicely juicy and flavored, the tomatoes and sauce paired very nicely, adding a nice touch of acidity and sweetness. The DjonDjon paella is nice and satisfying. It is not boldly flavored, which meant I could eat a lot of it in one sitting without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, like casual fine dining.

The diri djon djon (black rice) lacked all kinds of flavor. The sauce and banann was meh. The griot wasn’t bad, but I would’ve enjoyed it a lot more if the pikliz alongside it had any flavor.

The anchovy dish in particular was extremely disappointing: untoasted, cold slices of average bread, with unmelted butter and the anchovy on top is simply not a pleasant mouthfeel and it fails to bring out the flavors of each of the ingredients. The cocktails had a very syrupy mouthfeel and overly sweet flavor that masked any notes of the liquors used. Perhaps we \"ordered wrong\" but for the price it seems unacceptable that there would be wrong dishes to order.\n\nWe had one of each pici and they were good, but not enough to turn the evening around.

I’m originally from Texas and even though I’ve been gone from Texas for over a decade, it still gives me a lot of nostalgia vibes.\n\nMost times I’ve come here, I’ve made a reservation but it usually seems like walk-ins are available. I don’t believe they take reservations online, but you can make one over the phone.\n\nAs far as food, the queso and chips are so great and feels like TexMex quality. This is not a TexMex restaurant, to be clear, but it seems like standard Texas restaurant that offers a combination of Tex Mex and southern cuisine. Think of it as quirkier Willie’s Ice House. I also love the frito pie and the quesadillas. The frozen margaritas are some of the best in the city because they have a margarita machine whereas many places try to make them in a blender.\n\nSometimes certain servers can be a little cold or aloof, but generally they always get you what you need. I look forward to coming to this restaurant all the time and recommend it frequently, especially for groups.",

I actually had enough to take for later.

The crab cake was tasty, and it is mostly crab (which was excellent), but I felt for the price of $24 it was a bit small for that price.  Both my friend and I ordered steaks, her's was a touch over cooked as she wanted rare, mine was well cooked as I asked for medium-rare.  I really enjoyed the overall ambiance of the restaurant.  We opted for the outdoor seating as it was a gorgeous, cool summer evening.  I'd recommend this as a solid place to take a date as the establishment was great for having conversation, wasn't too loud at all.",

This is clearly a local favorite from the conversations we had with our neighboring tables but this was all destination dining for me and my best friend, Linette.\n\nLinette and I celebrated 35 plus years of friendship and are both originally from D.C.\nI live in New Zealand now and booked a hotel in Brooklyn specifically near Gertrude’s as I follow the chef Eli Sussman @gertrudesnyc - Partner/Exec Chef @talkininthewalkin on social media and was keen to try Gertrude’s with high expectations.\n\nThis election night  was magical  with the city feeling upbeat and positively giddy. I had told Gertrude’s it was our Frienniversery of 35 years and Allie the bartender greeted us with vodka beet juice shots that got the party started! Great introduction to Gertrude’s! Scott was our server with Lisa the floor manager stepping in at times to serve or check on us. Jacob and Reni were other servers that night on the floor.\n\nThe service was impeccable. Professional, of the highest standards, while warm and intimate. It’s an absolute pleasure when the service matches the excellence of the meal.\n\nGertrude’s was  outstanding Jewish Soul food, elevated comfort food to gladden the heart. We started with Challah Park rolls,Latkes with Crème Fraîche & Trout Roe and Beef Tongue Tartine. We were treated to Whitefiish & chips and housemade Spaetzle,  complimented from Gertrude’s. Everything was presented well: correct temperature, lovely plating. and delicious flavors. Ingredients balanced and complemented each other.\n\nLinette & I both had the 10oz Bavette Steak with sherry bordelaise, pickled shallot medium rare ( the best way!). The meat was beautifully marbled and perfect cooked. There was a choice of fries or salad greens. We chose fries.\nWonderful curated wine list to match and excellent recommendations from Lisa!\n\nTo finish, we had the Black & White ‘Seven Layer Cake’. My mom use to make us a chocolate layered cake with Sarah Lee pound cake (when guests over!) and it reminded me of being around the kitchen table with family and friends.\nA truly memorable dining out experience and evening that puts us in a New York State of Mind! A must experience in Brooklyn, New York.",

    "text": "I went in without the reservation on Saturday lunch. They managed to sit me at the counter bar. The brunch menu looks really good unfortunately I already had breakfast. So my husband ordered Chicken schnitzel which came with mash potatoes, beets sauce, chop cucumbers, onion, avocado and tomatoes. The chicken was don perfectly, crispy and moist. I had Kofta Kebab which is meatballs with humus, vegetable, and pita bread. There are still a lot of things on menu that I want to try. The service at the bar was pretty good, the bartender was very pleasant. The ambiance is airy with interesting art pieces displayed.",

Unfortunately, our last visit completely changed our impression.\n\nI was served raw chicken, which is not just unappetizing but a serious health risk. Our waiter agreed it was unacceptable and offered to replace the dish, which we appreciated. However, when the bill arrived, the replacement meal was still charged, and nobody apologized or made any gesture to acknowledge how serious the situation was.\n\nServing undercooked chicken is a major food safety issue, and the complete lack of accountability was shocking. I genuinely hope the management takes this seriously — this kind of incident simply shouldn’t happen in any restaurant.",

    "text": "ADDENDUM: The general manager at Miriam reached out in response to our feedback, apologized, and offered to replace the ruined clothing. We are truly grateful for her customer service! Will be increasing our rating from 1 to 3 stars to average our initial experience and the steps taken to rectify it.\n\nOriginal review below:\n\nWe dined at Miriam this evening. The food was good, the patio atmosphere was pleasant. Unfortunately at the end of the meal, the staff member cleaning the dishes off the table accidentally toppled the dishes onto my partner, spilling on his shirt and pants. Both are ruined. Initially, we were told his meal would be comped. I expressed some dissatisfaction with this (his shirt and pants cost more than a burger) and they then agreed to comp the whole bill (there were three of us dining). This was a step in the right direction, but it took about 15 minutes for this to be offered after the incident. No manager ever came to speak with us/apologize. I think the proper way for the restaurant to handle the situation would have been for the manager to come out immediately and ask (and then cover) the price of the outfit. While I appreciate the offer to cover the table’s bill, the outfit still costs much more than our total, and it was naturally a major inconvenience. While I don’t blame the staff member for the accident - things happen! - I do think the restaurant should have handled the aftermath better.",

But after my recent experience, I won’t be coming back.\n\nWhile eating the clam pizza, I bit into several hard, sharp pieces of clam shell baked right into the slice. It was painful and dangerous — I nearly cracked a tooth. For a place that prides itself on quality, this was completely unacceptable.\n\nWhat made it worse was how the situation was handled. I called a few days later to report the issue, hoping they’d show some concern or offer to make things right. Instead, I was met with complete indifference. No apology, no offer to help, nothing.\n\nIt’s really disappointing to be treated this way after years of being a loyal customer.

    "text": "I've been enjoying King David's Mediterranean food since the mid-70's. The original restaurant on Marshall Street was established by the father of the current owners who worked for their dad as young men. When the father retired, the business was divided, with one son opening a new restaurant in Fayetteville and the other taking over the Marshall Street location, but moving to a smaller upstairs space. Having eaten at both restaurants, it is my opinion that the larger Fayetteville restaurant serves the best food. The chicken pesto pizza is an excellent starter for 2-4 to share. The platform is a 12\" piece of crispy pita bread topped with delicious cheese, chicken, black olives, tomatoes, and pesto sauce. For your main course, try the babagnouge ala carte platter which includes salad, pita bread, and a falafel patty, or order the chicken shish kabob over rice which comes with salad, falafel, pita bread, and hummus. Other items on the menu that we love include the beef chawarma sandwich, the Greek salad with chicken, and when it's available, the mushroom soup. For something different, try the apricot nectar as a beverage. I think it pairs well with the food, particularly if you make liberal use of the hot sauce. At the far end of the dining room, there's a door leading to a skylight-lit patio that's pleasant in the summer. For lunch, you place your order at the register as you enter and it's delivered to your table. At dinner, you are seated and the waitstaff takes your order and brings your food. Service is excellent and the environment is relaxed and comfortable. UPDATE-1: It seems that the pita bread may be thinner than it once was. The beef shawarma sandwich falls apart pretty easily. Delicious with added Frank's Red Hot, but a little messy. UPDATE-2: I was up for a light lunch and chose a Greek salad without chicken. It served the purpose perfectly and tasted great. UPDATE-3: Even though the fattoush salad is no longer on the menu, the staff kindly prepared it for me. It was very good, but I do prefer the Greek salad.",

It was busy when we arrived but it still took less than 5 minutes to sit. The host gave us a booth with a view of the wood-fired pizza oven, which was greatly appreciated. I’m glad my girlfriend was in the mood for gluten-free Italian, which is what prompted my search in the first place. We wanted to try something new in the Ithaca area.\n\nService was excellent from start to finish. Our waitress was great. She was very attentive without coming across as overbearing. She did a great job of staying one step ahead at every opportunity.\n\nThe house bread dipped in the garlic-infused, seasoned oil was amazing. It set the right tone for our taste buds. Our entrees arrived before our appetizer. Although we didn’t mind, management apologized and didn’t hesitate to deduct the appetizer from the bill. They proceeded to serve the appetizer a few minutes after that. This made quite the impression on us because they did not have to do that. And I love a business that acts in good faith.\n\nThe meatball appetizer is highly recommended. I had a pasta dish that was similar to Utica’s chicken riggies. Every dish we had that involved red sauce tasted amazing.\n\nMy only constructive criticism is regarding the pear and gorgonzola pizza. I think this pizza could use more pear slices to help balance the dominant flavor of the gorgonzola. The tastiest bites included the pear. And perhaps this pizza could benefit from a drizzle (the aforementioned garlic oil, pesto, or balsamic would be perfect). I should have asked about adding a drizzle, given that this pizza was a bit on the dry side. It still tasted great and we were super happy with our food.\n\nWe wanted to try dessert and we opted for the chocolate mousse. It was the perfect dessert because you don’t need much room to eat it. And the chocolate mousse had a rich flavor without being too sweet.\n\nOverall, Ciao left a great impression on us. I would highly recommend this place. And next time I’m in the Ithaca area, I can’t wait to return to Ciao.",

A baffling mix of yellow and black lentils with random Rajma thrown in, cooked in a “unique” way that defies human understanding. Let me be clear: by no standards on this planet is this Dal Makhni.\n\nI asked for HOT spice level and got… dessert?? A bizarrely sweet dal that left me wondering if they confused “spicy” with “sugary.”\n\nThe rice? Weapon-grade hard. I nearly broke a tooth trying to crack them — clearly designed for people with titanium jaws and cast-iron stomachs. And the naan? Good luck. It was like chewing through a piece of hardened leather; I’m pretty sure medieval shields were softer.\n\nHonestly, this feels slightly less than a conspiracy against Indian food — more like a full-blown attack. What a shocking waste of time, money, and calories.\n\nIf they want to keep serving “Indian food,” someone on their team urgently needs to get on a plane to India and take notes. Completely, utterly disappointed.",

The salad bar, the meat, and the deserts! It met the expectations we had of an authentic Churrascaria. The Passion Fruit Mousse and Fried Polenta in particular was to die for.\n\nMaybe even more impressive than the food was the service. Everyone was very warm and attentive, and with a pace in their step. You can tell that they have the Brazilian work ethic of BEING A TEAM, everyone helps each other with everything. You never feel like you need to find \"your waiter\". Again, it was my birthday, and they made it special with a cheesecake and everything.\n\nA special thank you to Angel, Marcondes, and Portoncello for taking care of us and providing us with warm service.\n\nWe finally found a good Churrascaria in NYC!

I had a bunch of different stuff from the salad bar my favorite being the potato salad. My gf loved the sushi and other fish from the salad bar. We got back to the table and record our appetizers which just keep coming I choose cheese balls and she picked fries. The whole experience was very good. They also brought us out a piece of cake after for our anniversary. We left very happy and very full. Just be ready to pay, it is not cheap  but definitely worth a try 🙂",

There’s a full on buffet in the middle with everything from salad to tortellini  to sushi. I thought that part was crazy until the PARADE OF ALL YOU CAN MEAT STARTED. I’ve never had so much meat in one sitting. It was all quite tasty but included chicken, sausage, steak, steak, lamb, parm crusted pork, garlic steak. And we had sides as well.\n\nMy server was an older man who was actually quite hilarious. He took great care of us.",

The atmosphere had an almost luxury designer store vibe - polished and exclusive, but not at all welcoming. There’s also virtually no privacy; you’re seated barely a foot away from other diners, which makes the whole experience feel cramped and uncomfortable. The dishes themselves could’ve used more seasoning, especially for the price. Beware - an automatic 20% gratuity may or may not be added to your bill, even when your party doesn’t exceed 6 diners indicated on the menu (we only had two and it was added to our bill). Overall, it clearly caters to a very specific crowd, and the visit left me more disappointed than impressed.",

He was attentive without being intrusive, made fantastic menu recommendations, and ensured that everything came out perfectly timed and beautifully presented. His genuine kindness and charm added such a personal touch to our meal — we honestly couldn't have asked for better service.\n\nThank you, Ricardo, for making our day so enjoyable.

I remember going to the other location in downtown and having an amazing time, especially the food, drinks and the vibe! This location didn’t quite measure up.\n\nThe spicy guacamole lacked real heat and was more mild. The shrimp tacos were just okayish—it missed that fresh, vibrant flavor I was hoping for.\n\nWe ordered a guava margarita pitcher and it was a letdown as well! Tasted more like a syrupy cocktail mix than a refreshing drink.\n\nWhat did stand out for me though was the friendly and attentive host. She made the experience more pleasant for us.\n\nWhile nothing was particularly bad, but nothing really impressed us either. It’s a good spot for a casual meal, but it doesn’t deliver the same quality or flavors as the other location.",

The accompanying sauce had just the right amount of kick to complement the rich umami of the meat.\n\nIf you’re a fan of yakiniku or want to try something unique and luxurious, this beef tongue is a must-order. It’s as photogenic as it is delicious!",

A complimentary bread basket comes with a small dish of lentils, bread, and bread sticks which are delicious. I tried their salmon with mustard sauce ($39.50), ordered medium. It was served that way, it was moist and I enjoyed it. On another visit there I had their Chicken Paesano. The chicken pieces were not tender. On another visit there I tried their rabbit that came with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The rabbit ($49.50) had lost a lot of its flavor due to its preparation. The mashed potatoes were very enjoyable, the Brussels sprouts were good. A thin electric candle ads a nice touch to each table. They serve the same menu for lunch and dinner.",

While the wait can definitely be long during peak hours(1hr 30min on a Sunday evening), Raku SoHo is a cozy spot that delivers authentic noodles and thoughtful dishes once you’re seated.\n\nFor an appetizer you must try the chicken tatsuta-age which is wonderfully fried and seasoned. We loved the dipping sauce which perfectly compliments the chicken. We tried two hot udons, the tantan and the nabeyaki.\n\nThe tantan offered a rich and flavorful broth while not being too overwhelming. My only complaint would be that most of the pork and other components were under the noodles so I didn’t discover them until I was almost finished. The nabeyaki was a nice light soup with the same perfect noodles. It offered a lot of protein and a nicely balanced fishy flavor. The stand out of this dish was the shrimp tempura which was fried to perfection.\n\nMy only complaints would be of the tight seating arrangement. You will be practically sharing a table with the people around you if you are seated near the front. Overall, I cannot wait to come again and try more of their udon!",

Udon was also good, overall I loved this place and I was glad that my hubby discovered it lol. We walked there since we were there on a vacation. There’s no way we would drive around NY.

I’m assuming it’s a piece of black nitrile glove??\n- we opted to not tip because of these reasons, and the server thought it would be appropriate to “remind” us that tips aren’t included in the bill.

I was looking for a Thai restaurant to eat at with my family and this spot blew me away.\n\nIt is a small cozy little joint located at the bottom of the upper east side. Due to the size it is limited seating. Can possibly fit around 12 people or so. There's a nice little mural that someone painted. The menus on the TV are bright with clear pictures.\n\nI noticed they get plenty of door dash/Uber eats, etc.\n\nOur hostess was super sweet and caring. She attended to our needs and was very helpful. I had a question about what one of the dishes was and she looked it up on her phone to show me what it was.\n\nThe food definitely blew me away. It was surprisingly good. We had the crispy spring rolls, classic fried rice(Chicken), pad Thai (chicken), and a mango avocado salad. The fried rice was amazing. I've always prefer Thai fried rice compared to other Asian fried rices. It didn't taste super greasy and it had the right amount of eggs and chicken and vegetables. The salad was perfectly riped. A great combo of mango and avocado with onions/cashews and an Asian sauce. Very fresh and delicious. The crispy spring rolls came in a set of 4. They tasted great are also a nice size, not too small. It was paired with a sweet chili sauce for dipping.The pad Thai was delicious 🤤 not too dry and just the right amount of oil. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The portion was a great size. I ended up taking the fried rice and pad Thai in a to go container. She was nice enough to box up the food for us.\n\nWe also ordered Thai tea. It was the final piece of the puzzle to balance out the spicy meals.\n\nWe definitely recommend this place. Everyone please try it. Would definitely try again if we're in the area.",

In my opinion, the sauces were too weak to really enhance the entree. However it came in a medium sized pot with a handle, making it easy to use and share.\n\nThe only thing that stood out to me was the creamed spinach. Every bite was quite rich but wasn't too dense.\n\nDid I have a good time with my meal? Yes.\nDid the flavors blow my mind? No.\nWould I come back? Probably no. But I don't regret coming here.",

It was smooth and beautiful.\n\nI ordered lobster bisque, a NY strip cooked medium rare, and a side of toasted wild mushrooms.\n\nThe bread was quite nice. They gave me one nice looking one and a one that was kinda ugly. Turned out, the look did matter. The nice looking one was way softer than the ugly one.\n\nThe lobster bisque was nice. Very pungent and thick. It also had a generous amount of lobster claws meat chunks. However, some of them were a bit overcooked and some were perfectly tender.\n\nThe NY strip came out pretty well. The meat was pink and tender. Very flavorful. It came with roasted garlic. The garlic was smooth like mashed potatoes, and it was fragrant but not stinky.\n\nThe side of roasted wild mushrooms was very nice, too. Usually, they can be a bit oily and greasy, but here, they were cooked to almost perfectly. Almost, because they were a bit bland, and they were a bit too dry.\n\nOverall, it was a nice restaurant with a good atmosphere. Even though, I still wish they could pick up the speed a bit. Between the time I finished my lobster bisque and my NY strip was served, I waited for 35 minutes. They can probably do that for the party of 2 or more, but for a person who was eating by himself, I’d like to just finish and leave.",

Service is slow and non attentive at best. Steak was bland , sides were same and the bacon barely cooked even when sent back and asked for it well done came back out the same . Waiter was robotic no personality , not what you expect from a “steakhouse” waiter . Overall aside from a drink and maybe a quick app at bar this place really should do better or change the name . Sub par across the board minus the atmosphere.",

Spaghetti with clams had tiny clams and the flavor was quite ordinary—I’ve had this dish at many Italian restaurants in the United States and in various towns in Italy. This dish here is only ordinary. The pasta is not al dente, and the olive oil didn’t taste like high-quality Italian olive oil, and the clams are just too small, and perhaps it’s lacking some garlic flavor (in Italy this dish is usually cooked with garlic and the olive oil and parsley flavors should stand out as well as the vongole). For the price they charge, I expect better. Appetizer was very good though, still portion size is quite small compared to other Italian restaurants in UWS. The puttanesca is good though a bit salty.\n\nThey have both indoor seating and sidewalk seating. Sidewalk seating is on a busy main street so you might get some strange reactions from passersby.",

Adding some mint and nuts made for the perfect bite.  Meat and cheese platter was also very good, the meats was sliced very thin which was great, but I would have appreciated if they told us the types of cheeses we were eating (the meats were obvious). Also would have like to have known what the garnish was as I couldn’t place it, it didn’t taste strong enough to be candied ginger but it may have been.    I did ask what all of these were and was told someone would come and explain but they never did. Bread basket was a combination of toasted and fresh bread served with tasty olive oil.    When you first walk in there is a counter where they sell their meats, cheeses and salads, all looked delicious and while we were they the counter was very busy. Overall liked this restaurant and would recommend.",

When I asked why, I was completely ignored. On top of that, the older lady at the register showed zero interest in serving me. She pinched the money from my hand like she didn’t even want to take it. The combination of ridiculous price hikes and rude service makes this place a hard pass for me. Definitely not worth it!",

Light, tasty, and a fantastic appetizer. For mains, we had the Goat (Hilib Ari) and the Lamb Shoulder. The lamb was a little on the dry side, but the goat was absolutely sublime—so tender it melted in your mouth, with amazing flavors and seasoning.

She is extremely rude, disrespectful, and talks to customers in a very unprofessional way. Yesterday she even overcharged me for two slices — almost $14— and I only noticed when I got home. I paid with a credit card, so I didn’t see the total right away.\nHer attitude is unacceptable. I hope the management pays attention to this, because customers shouldn’t be treated like this.\n\nUPG: Please listen to me for a moment. I completely understand that you are a family-run business, and maybe this cashier is your relative — your sister, daughter, or someone close. But that does not give her the right to speak to customers in a raised voice, be disrespectful, rude, or make personal comments.\n\nTo be honest, I really like your pizza. I like the place, the atmosphere, everything. But I will never come back again — not because of your food or prices, but because of this one cashier. And as long as she continues to work there, I personally will not return.\n\nI have also spoken with several neighbors in our area, and everyone says the same thing — her rudeness is not only toward customers, but also toward delivery workers and even other staff. It creates a very unpleasant experience.\n\nPlease don’t reply with a standard template message. Just take this seriously and pay attention to the situation.",

Even a basic slice is as pricey as you'd pay down on Bleecker Street, so don't expect any uptown discount. But their Vodka Slice worth every damn penny. The wife and I prefer to come in and get various slices between the two of us, because a whole pie can set you back over $30 at times.\n\nPro Tip: Pay in cash. Pay a little less.\n\nAs with most other spots in the 'hood, you'll be left supplementing your own salt and seasoning, because the aging demographic has a stranglehold on every restaurant in the area in regards to sodium content. The white-haired rabble generally want the bare minimum. And they complain about. A lot. I guess they're salty enough.\n\nFresco's also has a nice spread of different slices--especially white pies--which is pretty unique to most other spots in the city, who only offer red pies. They're absolutely a class above most other pizza joints in the neighborhood.\n\nIt's a family run shop, so you'll see the same people behind the counter time after time. Most of the time they're pretty friendly, especially the dudes baking your slices, they go the extra mile to keep you returning and will make small talk if they're not overwhelmed. Good fellas.\n\nIf you haven't been inside and only walked by outside, you've assuredly dodged the swath of bikes and delivery guys outside that make it look like a post-apocalyptic bicycle gang occupies their space, but it just turns out they're one of the most delivered pizza joints in the entire US, so I can only assume they know what they're doing to keep people happy. I sure am.",

No vegetables in the dish, no soy sauce and no chili sauce. For the cost, a little crazy. We had to channel the vegetables previously cooked in the same wok through the noodles to pretend to enjoy it. A little effort in dish would have gone a long way. When you order ask what else is in your dishes before trusting the menu. I get simplicity but for $20 bucks that was under simple.",

We ordered pan fried dumplings, tofu skin with cedar sauce, mixed sea food with cedar sauce in taro bowl, eggplant in spicy laksa sauce, Buddha’s delight pan fried noodles, and Fujian fried rice.\n\nEverything was so delicious. I love their cedar sauce. It goes so well with everything, and it’s so fragrant and savory.\n\nMy favorite dish was the mixed seafood with cedar sauce in taro bowl. It has been my no. 1 for a long time. I have to get it whenever I’m here. I also love the Buddha’s delight pan fried noodles. The crunchy noodles with slightly gluey sauce were just perfect. Especially when the noodles were mixed with the sauce and got a bit saggy, it was the most delightful texture. The braised tofu skin with cedar sauce was also very good. I especially love the cabbage they put in the bottom of the plate. It absorbs the flavor and with the sweetness of its own.\n\nIt was my first time trying their Fujian fried rice. The idea was very similar to the Buddha’s delight pan fried noodles, but replaced the noodles with fried rice. I love the bits of the ham in the sauce.\n\nEverything was simply delicious, but just like almost all Chinese food, it’s a bit greasy. Good thing was they had some tea to go with it. The servers were also pretty pleasant and friendly.",

The Aquatic Duck Dance was tender and rich with red curry and fruit, while the Velvet Egg Octopus was perfectly cooked with a hint of sweetness. The Quick & Crunch duck salad was refreshing with a great balance of tangy and spicy flavors.\n\nThe cocktails were just as good, we tried the Lychee Martini, Mai Tai, and their Buy 2 Get 1 Free mystery drink, all delicious and fun for fall evenings.\n\nThe restaurant itself is cozy and elegant with great lighting and a welcoming vibe. Service was attentive and friendly throughout. Definitely one of the best Thai spots in Bushwick, we’ll be back soon!",

The space has this perfect balance of industrial and modern décor exposed brick, soft lighting, and elegant touches that make it feel both stylish and welcoming. It’s one of those restaurants where you notice the details right away, from the furniture to the way the dishes are plated.\nI stopped in for their lunch special, which I thought was a great deal. The prices are fairly affordable considering the quality and the portions the servings are actually quite large, so you definitely won’t leave hungry. I ordered the chili fish, and it was excellent flavorful, fresh, and just the right level of spice. The food came out quickly, which I really appreciated during lunch hours.\nI also tried the egg and scallion stuffed pancake, which ended up being one of my favorite parts of the meal.

    "text": "5-Star Review for Birds of a Feather (Williamsburg, Brooklyn)\nBirds of a Feather – A True Gem for Foodies and Friend Hangouts!\nIf you're looking for that perfect spot where incredible food meets unbeatable vibes, Birds of a Feather in Williamsburg is your answer. This Sichuan-inspired Chinese restaurant, born from the genius minds behind Michelin-starred Cafe China, nails the balance of authentic flavors and chill atmosphere every time.\nI've made it a ritual to come here with my crew – it's hands-down my top go-to place for group hangs. The space feels warm and inviting, with those subtle nods to Chengdu's laid-back greenery that make you forget you're in the heart of Brooklyn. Whether we're splitting plates after a long week or celebrating a birthday, the energy just flows – spacious tables, dim lighting, and that effortless cool factor that keeps conversations going all night.\nBut let's talk food, because oh man, it's on another level. Top-tier doesn't even cover it – every dish is a flavor explosion. The Dan Dan noodles? Silky, spicy, and nutty perfection that had us all fighting for the last bite. We couldn't resist the cumin lamb skewers (smoky, tender, and addictive) or the mapo tofu, which brings just the right heat without overwhelming. Portions are generous for sharing, and the cocktails (shoutout to the yuzu margarita) cut through the spice like a dream. Service is spot-on too – attentive but not hovering, which lets you focus on the good times.\nPrice-wise, it's a steal for the quality – expect around $50-70 per person with drinks, and you'll leave stuffed and smiling. If you love bold, authentic eats in a spot that's as fun for friends as it is delicious, do yourself a favor and book a table. Birds of a Feather isn't just a meal; it's a vibe. Can't wait to go back! 🌶️🍜 5/5 stars.",

The portions are large at this restaurant. The quality doesn't miss no matter if I dine in or order delivery.\nChungking chicken comes with crunchy small chicken bites, loaded with chillies, packed with flavors and that mouth numbing spiciness. Kung pao chicken is tender, velvety texture. Spicy fish filled is my favorite dish; it's comes with small fried fish fillers, crunchy, perfect moisture level with that signature spiciness of szechuan chilies. Mapo tofu is also one of the must try dish, hot tofu on a bed of spicy ground pork sauce. It's perfect for any dinner meal. Spicy cumin lamb is absolutely the most tender and flavorful lamb I have had in a long time. Tea smoked duck offers juicy smoked duck slices, pairs well with buns and sauce.\nThe restaurant can get really crowded during dinner time. It is suggested to get a reservation ahead of time or to stop by at odd hours to avoid waiting in line.\nOverall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves to enjoy Chinese cuisine or just loves to incorporate chilies in their meals.",

Took a bit to get our table but seemed like it was just people staying too long that caused backup. The place was sooo cute and cool and the bathroom was like a mini club which I loved. Music was perfect, playing all my favorites. Waitress was AWESOME and super helpful. We got espresso martinis which came out quick and green beans and wontons to start. Green beans turned out to be our fav fish and were delicious with some fried bread on top. Great flavor. Wontons were good too and had a curry/Indian flavor. I thought they could have been hotter (temp and spice level), but we enjoyed them. we also got the noodles. I personally don't like the rolled noodles and I thought the flavor was weird. But my friend loved them.  Overall really thought this was a cool place and enjoyed our experience but didn't wow me like other spots in NYC. I'm also really tired of cocktails being $20, but I guess that's just what the reality is these days.",

Had heard ravings about the MSG martini which we tried, and also tried the sour cherry Negroni - neither were spectacular and the martini had a strange aftertaste.\n\nFor food, we ordered the chrysanthemum salad (Don Angie’s is so much better) - which was a large portion but mostly cabbage (?), the long beans were too mushy for my liking (liked the fried crullers but they were overly salty), the fuyu cacio e pepe mein which was just ok, and the sundae for dessert which was not that interesting (I liked the fried condensed milk). We also had the shrimp with walnuts and broccoli which was pretty basic. Overall, the food was pretty disappointing and I would not go back…",

    "text": "OK, so I came here tonight and I have never heard of this place before. Everything was pretty good nothing was amazing and nothing was terrible. I will say that the shrimp with the candied walnuts were really good and the long beans were also pretty good. I ordered the mussels with the shoestring fries and when it came out, it had pieces of what looked like some kind of pork on top so I asked the server is that pork? and they said yes and I said oh no I can’t eat that so they brought it back and gave me the menu to pick something else, and I asked if I could have the same thing but with no pork and they said they couldn’t do that because it was in the broth so when I looked at the menu again, I realized it mentioned nowhere that there was pork in there, which is kind of annoying because if it wasn’t directly on top, I would’ve never known it was in the broth. I heard this place is extremely popular and I don’t know I’ve had much better food for lower prices and just better food in general. I also was not a fan of the flounder at all. It tasted like it had piña colada sauce on it, but my partner liked it so..",

    "text": "The mussels were good, the broth was extremely flavorful and creamy, but way too salty. The fries also ended up a bit soggy, and we needed more fries for the broth, if that was the intention. We ended up with a bunch of leftover broth that was too salty to drink on its own. Some bread would have been nice for this.\n\nThe chow feung was pretty good, but really small and underwhelming for the price. I also thought this was too salty. The texture of the rice noodles was nice though, and i really liked the flavor of the dried shrimp.\n\nThe bkrib.. It was good. I really liked the fluffinesses and the flavor of the bread, the sauce on the meat, and it was cooked okay. Maybe a bit overcooked. The onions and pickles provided a nice contrast. Not show stopping though. This was also too salty.\n\nThe half chicken was pretty good as well. The broth was my favorite part. The flavor and cook on the chicken was good, but the rice didn’t really make any sense. It was yummy, but it felt as though the rice and the chicken were two completely separate dishes. The chicken was also too salty.\n\nI would say the food is pretty good, maybe not worth the price, and my  main issue is the overall saltiness of the dishes. I typically eat saltier foods than my peers, but even after drinking 3 full glasses of water during this meal, my mouth is left with a tingling feeling and I need more water.",

The agnolotti is to die for. Perfectly balanced and very rich and complex. We also enjoyed the focaccia and the little gem salad as appetizers. The prosciutto was okay, and the arancini were also only okay. Mafaldini pasta was good. The italian job dessert was good but we expected better from all the hype.

Mozz and bread is a large portion but absolutely worth trying. Cheese was soft and flavorful and bread was thick and crusty.   Little gem salad as pretty to look at as it was to eat.   Grilled artichoke, I probably could have eaten 5.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Bagna Cauda was a miss for us. The anchovy dip was overpowering and I think I just didn’t understand the dish.  We tried the agnolotti based on our server’s recommendation and so glad we did.  Soft creamy pillows of deliciousness. Spaghetti also delicious, pasta was al dente with texture from the nuts.   Escarole was another recommended dish and it was very good and a nice side. The lamb steak was our other miss. It was cooked well but if I didn’t know I was eating lamb I would have thought it was a bland steak.  It had no gamey lamb flavor.  We didn’t know but will try next time that there is an off the menu steak and potato dish you can order. It looked and smelled amazing.  This restaurant serves unpretentious delicious food, can’t wait to return and try more options.",

    "text": "We decided to go here as a central meeting point for folks coming from Jersey and Long Island. I had been to a Japanese BBQ place where you cook your own food, this was a little different. The place is spacious and brightly lit as the sitting areas need to be spaced out(cooking areas and smoke hoods), you sat on stools that you can store your items in. You chose the type of meat selection from 3 choices. The whole table must choose the same menu course. You are on a timer but we weren't affected. There are many selections, so make sure to try all of them at least once. The tray can cook 2 portions at a time and once it gets cooking 4-5 adults will having trouble keeping up, but we have it our all. The food was delicious, they cook it all for you. Pork, beef was best we didn't try the chicken. The Soju was awesome; pomegranate, lychee and blueberry... All very tasty. Make sure to get lettuce and rice. The salad was also very tasty. Just be careful and observant; when the server pulled back from placing meat on the cooking tray, some of the meat juice fell on the salad. We set that salad aside immediately. I definitely want to come back the seats were ok, but I dunno how long we can sit on those seats. Price was reasonable. Definitely go here and check it out.",

The staff seemed super authentic Nepali too, both in how they talked and acted, which was a nice touch.\n\nFood was good! I’d say go for the beef (yes they are halal) options if you’re into meat — the chicken momos were okay but had more veggies than chicken. Loved the Thai Soup Momo (gave off a bit of a butter chicken vibe) and of course, the Chilli Momos are always a win.\n\nBonus points for the super clean washrooms — seriously, top-notch. Overall, I’d give it an 8.5/10. Great spot, just a little pricey for students.",

I had the Madrid Strew (Chickpeas and Tripe with Chorizo), my Mom had Mussels, Scampi style and our friend had Fried Calamari.  We were all very happy with our appetizers.  Then for our entrées, we all had Merluza which in English is Hake.  We each had it in a different preparation.  There was grilled, stewed and breaded.  Mine was Grilled and it came with vegetables and a choice of a side.  I chose Boiled Potatoes.  My Mom chose to have it in Stew which is served in sauce and with Potatoes and our friend chose the Breaded version with a choice of a side.  She had the French Fries.  We were all happy with the preparation we chose.  The servings were large.  We all took food home.  We all had Flan for dessert and it was very good.  My Mom had Wine, our friend had Sangria and I had Estrella, a beer from Spain.  The prices are very good here.  The service is excellent. We came in the afternoon but in the evenings they have entertainment.  I don't know if it's every evening or only on certain evenings.  I have to look into that.  The space reminds me of a small scale Supper Club.  There is also a area off to the side with a Bar, t.v.'s and seats.  We will definitely go back, maybe when they have a show.  I also have to say,  we've been to Spain on several occasions and the food here is as good and even better than in some Restaurants in Spain.  Forgot to mention that we each got a Bailey's, on the house.  It's very rare for restaurants to do that nowadays.",

Everything was delicious and well-balanced. The potato pancakes were finely grated, giving them that perfect classic flavor — especially good with the sour cream sauce. The cabbage roll was juicy, and the cabbage itself was tender and slightly sweet — cooked to perfection.\n\nBefore the meal, they served two slices of bread with butter — the butter was rich and flavorful. For dessert, I had three cheese-filled crepes (nalysnyky) — huge, creamy, and served with a refreshing lemon sauce. I could only finish one and took the rest to go.\n\nThe service was quick and attentive, the food was fresh, and presentation neat. The total bill came to $34 — a great value for such quality.

    "text": "Traditional Polish Comfort Food with Great Service\n\nReview:\nOn a business trip in Buffalo, I was looking for something unique and stumbled upon Polish Villa, a traditional Polish mom-and-pop spot. The restaurant isn’t flashy, but it was bustling with locals even on a Thursday night, which felt like a good sign.\n\nThe server was friendly and helpful, offering suggestions for a first-timer like me. I went with her recommendation, the Polish platter, which included a hearty spread: one golabek, one kielbasa with onions and sauerkraut, two pierogi, a potato pancake, and a bowl of soup. The soup was a nice surprise—different but delicious. The meal came out simply plated, not fancy, but everything tasted fresh and comforting. The pierogi were my favorite, and the kielbasa was flavorful. The golabek was good, though I wasn’t a huge fan of their sauce.\n\nOverall, it was a solid, authentic Polish meal with attentive service. A good spot to try traditional dishes, though I probably wouldn’t go back again.",

But what I have gotten has consistently been fantastic - some highlights include:\n\n- Oroshi tonkatsu set: the katsu is so yummy with a wonderful texture (fried to a good balance of not being too oily or soggy). The whole set comes with a generous amount of food (soup, salad as well), and specifically I just love the taste of oroshi in the light dashi broth. I’ve also had the curry katsu before - the curry itself was pretty good, nothing too notable to point out, and the katsu was similarly delicious.\n\n- Sukiyaki donburi was a particular favourite. The sweet flavour went with the tender sliced beef so nicely, and it came with a good assortment of tofu, veggies, and egg for a very well balanced dish. Yakiniku don was yummy too - not too salty, beef savoury and well-cooked, and the rice/sauce combo complemented everything nicely.\n\nI’ve had the chicken karaage as an appetiser a few times before, and it was a bit inconsistent each time (sometimes a bit soggy breading / not tender meat). I feel like it’s not really worth the price (especially compared to the cost most of the main dishes on the menu).\n\nIndeed, overall the price point is very solid here - esp for the neighbourhood. Even though I read some reviews suggesting that they are a no-tip restaurant, I fear this may no longer be the case, sigh. Would love to come back again soon!",

The sound of a cocktail lounge with small bites is really good but they were playing the most random songs that did not add to the ambiance at all.

Pass on the croquettes and pigs in a blanket, they only come with a couple of them and leave you wanting more. Lastly the cocktails. They sounds really interesting and tasteful but when you drink it, its very lacklustre. The sweet ones are too sweet and the savoury ones are not savoury enough.

The fried tofu and the calamari with that sweet and spicy sauce were amazing. So tasty!\n\nIt’s a bit of a shame they don’t offer bubble tea anymore, since that used to be a nice bonus. Still, this place is definitely worth visiting, and I’ll be coming back many more times!",

Ordered the Lay rolls, which was the only dish that was not satisfactory. They were dry and had what I believed to be insufficient filling. The brief taste of the filling was quite good however. Ordered the wings for an appetizer. They were crispy, cooked perfectly and the saucy was sweet and delicious. We had the red snapper for an entree and it was also perfect. The fish was whole cooked and perfectly fresh. Snapper is my favorite and this was soooo delicious. It was enough for two to share. We ordered a plate of rice - the pineapple which was equally delicious and paired wonderfully with the fish. I would definitely return. I live in the area and this a great local spot!!! Yummy 😋",

The Khao Tom Haeng was excellent, the mixture of all meats (pork belly, Chinese sausage, minced pork & shrimp) were all delicious. The Gaeng Hung Lay Nuar was super tender and flavorful. The stewed beef in curry was so soft and was excellent when paired with the rice. The last dish, Pla Tod Samun Prai which is a fried branzino with lots of herbs and spices. It was super soft and flaky and the herbs, onions and garlic and other items went so well with it. Probably one of our favorite dishes of the night.\n\nThe staff was super nice and very attentive. The table we had was small but it managed to fit everything! There's seating inside and a canopy for outside seating. You can make reservations ahead of time. The atmosphere is great and lively and a very busy come popular dining times.",

Their presentation and refinement took it to another level — both visually and flavor-wise. Another must-try is the fried branzino — perfectly crisp on the outside, tender and flaky inside.\n\nWhether you’re a longtime Thai food lover or just looking to try something new, this Brooklyn gem is worth the ride.\n\nFollow me @foodie.elite on IG and Tiktok for more!",

Nico, The manager is always thinking about every detail, trying to give you the best service. We are new in the neighborhood and this is our place for breakfast or brunch, but I’m pretty sure that they have many options for dinner and even live music on weekends. It’s a place that you have to visit in Kendall, in my opinion, is a hidden treasure in the Neighborhood.",

We didn't want to deal with the craziness of hosting a huge wedding, so when we came to Bootlegger's they instantly made us feel heard and seen. We used their \"Perfect night\" catering package and added on some extra sides. The staff went above and beyond in getting the white linens and low rounds to really make the aesthetic work well for our event. All our guests were amazed at how tasty the food was and they haven't stopped raving about it since! The staff tended to my wife and I the whole night.

The tables where we sat were for enough away that it felt separate from the bar area, though. Also of note, bathrooms were very clean, which says a lot.\nOur waitress was friendly and attentive. She took our order promptly and the appetizers (mozzarella sticks and soup) came out quickly. The entrees arrived hot and as we asked for them.\nLast, but definitely not least, the food was awesome! The mozzarella sticks were 6 to an order (I love when it's an even number) and I really loved the marinara sauce. The Buffalo chicken chowder was so good! A little bit of heat, lots of chicken and veggies, and just thick enough.\nWe ordered the chicken tenders, which had a light and crunchy beer batter coating. If the batter is the same, I can't wait to try the fried fish next. We also tried the Cowboy burger. It came out medium well as we had asked and had just the right amount of bbq (I hate when they pour it on and soak the bun). Fries were good too.\nOverall, a pleasant experience all around and we will be back to try other items too. You should stop by yourself and give it a try.",

Personally, I prefer the frozen as they have the perfect consistency. I ordered the frozen coconut (which is out of this world) and my friend got the frozen blood orange marg which was also incredible. My one little critique is that what is labeled on the menu as a “quesadilla” is indeed NOT at all a quesadilla. It’s literally a soft taco with little to no cheese, but I will give them this- they are delicious. The chorizo is a big hit here and is full of flavor, but please just add more cheese!!! That’s the entire point of a (quesa)dilla, LOL. The service is great here and the atmosphere is relaxed, but it’s also very fun with the festive decor and upbeat tunes in the background.",

We went for Saturday lunch, and overall, the experience was enjoyable.\n\nWe started with the potato pancakes, which we really liked. They were served with both applesauce and sour cream — my first time trying that combination. The applesauce was an interesting (and surprisingly tasty) pairing.\n\nFor my main dish, I ordered the Sauerbraten. The sauce it came with was described as sweet and sour, but I found it mostly sweet — which worked well for me. The beef was a little on the dry side, though I’m not sure if that’s typical for the dish. It came with a potato dumpling that was more like a scoop of mashed potatoes, and a side of red cabbage that had a pleasantly sweet flavor — not what I expected, but I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe wifey ordered the Wiener Schnitzel and absolutely loved it. It came with a small serving of lingonberries, home fries, and the same red cabbage that I had.\n\nOverall, we both enjoyed our meal and would definitely come back to try other dishes on the menu.",

Warm, helpful, professional service; our waiter let us taste an unfamiliar wine which we loved and wound up ordering. Food was delicious - I had the meatball sandwich (not sure if only avail at lunch): tender, flavorful meatballs, excellent bright sauce and not too much bread, with a peppery arugula salad on the side. Companions were very happy with their food as well. Really good place, will definitely return.",

I’m always trying to find a good Indian take out and hate taking risks to be disappointed. I was certainly not with Tandoor Oven. The chicken tikka is fresh and succulent, not rubbery, and feels like good quality meat and ingredients. It’s spiced to perfection, I don’t like when it’s too creamy, but the ratio of cream to curry is on point and the flavor is just perfect. It’s exactly what you’re looking for when you’re craving chicken tikka masala. I’ve been eating Indian food all my life and I have to say this place is top 5 for me at least. I’m so impressed and can’t wait to try more of their food! If you’re contemplating where to order on the upper east side, look no further.",

Lunch service seemed to be staffed well, plenty of people circulating and the seating  was instant. Our food was prompt to arrive at the table, hot and ready to eat. Overall service was good. We sat down to a gorgeous outdoor October lunch.\n\nWings were a great appetizer, crispy and sizeable but the BBQ sauce seemed to be the entire flavor profile and the chicken offered nothing of its own; not a deal breaker. Budget pretzel bites with your standard grocery store brown mustard are genuinely overpriced for what they are; lesson learned if there is a future visit. Sadly, the pulled pork sandwich my wife ordered disappointed us the most. The pork was hardly pulled, more of a chunked consistency which gave careless vibes from the kitchen staff and the pork offered nothing without the (same) BBQ sauce to save the day.  The fries that came with both dishes seemed to be from 3 separate time zones. Some were fresh, some were dry, others were stale.  I ordered the Fried Cod sandwich ( with fries ) which I can't say bad things about, but I wouldn't pay for it again.  We love to support our local businesses and eat out regularly in the river towns so I hope this was a fluke.",

The pizza looks like it could be good as does the chicken parm...  but I didn't order these.  I would order the Chicken Parm if I were to do it all over again.  Why didn't I this time?  Well, this dish is so much better with veal, I figured I would be disappointed and they don't offer it with veal.  Quite frankly one measure I use for a good Italian spot so fail number one.  Unfortunately if you didn't want pizza the menu was challenging -as in to find something interesting-  and the server staff not helpful at all.   I ended up getting the spaghetti with garlic and oil; and it was extremely disappointing.  I personally could have cooked the same dish a 100x better easily.  Basically tasted almost like plain noodles.  In other words you get very close just by boiling noodles in water.  At $21/22 dollars before tax it was just a ripoff.  Easily the worst Italian dish I've had in as long as I can remember...years and years.   Making it worse this place was cash only, just making the bad food inconvenient as well.   Nothing here to make me ever go back.  Given that other people have rated it higher, I guess I just ordered poorly....",

The homemade pasta special of the day (ours was a tagliatelle Bolognese) was a standout—saucy, savory, and clearly made with care. Same goes for the pizza: thin, crisp crust with a char that tells you someone back there knows what they’re doing. This isn’t fine dining and it doesn’t pretend to be—thankfully. It’s cozy, loud, slightly chaotic, and full of charm. The chicken Parm is textbook in the best way: crispy breading, gooey cheese, rich sauce. Service was fast and unfussy. It’s the kind of place that feels like it’s been holding it down for decades because it has. If you want polished and pretentious, go elsewhere. If you want legit red-sauce comfort and a room with character, Little Frankie’s delivers.",

AGAIN!\n\nThe term 'izakaya' is a fusion of 'i' (to stay) and 'sakaya' (sake shop) so we did just that- small plates tapa style and ideal to bring a partner in crime to try more- and otherwise \"izayaka\" typically described as a local food tavern / pub- but hands down appeasing our hungry palettes and and certainly plan to go back! Taste and enjoy... slowly! We got super lucky that on a Saturday night after 7 there was a table for 2 as walk-ins!\n\nAdmitting I've tried making Takoyaki at home (still work in progress), but soooo tasty here (main pic) as was the grilled hamachi collar ( yellowtail collar aka \"fish cheeks\"- portion behind the gills that I don't see often & loved when I lived in LA near LIttle Tokyo- and could find more regularly), pork belly mazemen (comes on a bed of ramen), softshell crab roll, seaweed salad and - and well, I'm usually too excited partaking to take pics, but just sharing a few here for good measure. Staff was busy and for such a small crew working small plates- and doing so much- yet super nice and friendly!\n\nDefinitely hope to go back myself for the sashimi and rolls- and for dinner again with my honey to share and try the blue fin tuna rib, short rib, and Karaage (fried chicken)... and meanwhile simply confirming how much dinner last night hit the spot- SUCH a nice treat- and ready to return for round 2! 😍🙏🏽",

It’s nice to have some asian flavors in the neighborhood 😊\nAll the food tastes great. The pork belly mazemen was our favorite! The pork was really well seasoned and the poached egg and sauce that coats the noodles was so luxurious. The whole squid and the grilled vegetables were probably the weakest dishes. The squid was nicely cooked and the sauce was tasty, but it could have used some lemon. The sauce on the grilled vegetables was also really yummy but we felt the vegetables themselves could have been cooked a bit longer; they were on the harder side to bite into. Everything else tasted great! Next time we’ll make sure we order one serving of yuzu cheesecake per person, instead of sharing 😅\nThe servers were very sweet and attentive though the food took a while to come out. Probably just due to it being the first week of opening and assume they’re still smoothing out the logistics.\nIt was a little bit on the pricey side—we spent $100+ for two people with no drinks.\nOverall we’ll definitely be back and will bring our friends in the neighborhood too!",

She simply dropped the check on my table without a word or even a simple thank you.\n\nFortunately, the male server was kind and offered a pleasant farewell when I left, which helped end the visit on a better note.

The moment it arrives, you’re greeted by the intoxicating aroma of toasted chilies, garlic, and peppercorns that promise both fire and finesse. The lobster itself is perfectly cooked—tender and juicy inside, encased in a thin, golden-crisp shell that crackles at first bite.\n\nWhat makes this dish unforgettable is the balance: the numbing warmth of authentic Szechuan peppercorns dancing with the sweetness of fresh lobster meat, all glazed in a glossy, slightly smoky sauce that clings lovingly to every piece. Each mouthful is a symphony of crunch, spice, and ocean-fresh flavor.\nPair it with steamed rice or simply savor it on its own—it’s the kind of plate that makes you slow down, close your eyes, and appreciate how perfect seafood can be when prepared with mastery.\n\nRed Chilli’s presentation is stunning, too—the deep crimson chilies scattered like jewels, the lobster gleaming beneath a light dusting of scallions and sesame. It’s a show-stopping dish that feels festive yet refined.\n\nWhether you’re a spice lover or just someone who appreciates fine seafood, this Crispy Szechuan Lobster is reason enough to visit Red Chilli. Once you try it, you’ll find yourself planning your next trip back before you’ve even finished the plate.",

Their desserts and cocktails are a highlight.\n\nService & Management: 0/5\nSadly, the management ruined what could have been a perfect evening. My sister and I visited on a freezing winter night in NYC (December 2024) with a small, securely wrapped bag of lemons in our tote. Despite our confirmed reservation, the receptionist rudely assumed we intended to eat outside food and made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome from the start.\n\nThe tasting menu we ordered was incredible, but we were hurried to place our order and finish quickly because the kitchen was “closing soon.” If the restaurant plans to close, why accept reservations for that time? The entire dinner felt rushed.\n\nAfter paying, we waited inside for our cab, only to be asked to step out into sub-zero temperatures so they could lock up. It was one of the coldest nights of the season.\n\nI genuinely feel bad for the chef—their exceptional culinary talent deserves management that respects guests and complements the food. The kitchen is brilliant, but the hospitality was so poor it overshadowed the meal.",

We had the malai paneer pinwheel, fries, and their chai , all vegetarian and all really flavorful. The pinwheel was rich and satisfying, and the fries were crispy with a fun twist of Indian spices. The chai was warm, comforting, and felt thoughtfully made, not just an afterthought. Prices are definitely on the higher side for lunch, but the quality and experience made it worth it. Great spot if you’re looking for elevated vegetarian options in the city.",

For small plates we had dahi puri where the light & airy yogurt mousse with the aloo masala create a medley in your mouth. We also ordered stuffed tandoori mushroom ( the best tandoori item I have ever tasted outside India in US) & my personal favourite Paneer chilli (chef’s kiss)!!\nFor large plates we had vegetable+ ricotta kofta, malai paneer pinwheel & dal makhni. All 3 dishes were with just the right amount of flavours & spice!! For desserts we ordered basque cheesecake & stone fruit cassata (my favourite)\nBaar baar food was indulgent & lip smacking! I am sure the non- vegetarian dishes are equally tasty. Look forward to more trips to the restaurant!",

The ambience is superb with LoFi music, beautiful decoration, and mood lighting that is bright enough to see your food, but dim enough to not hurt the eyes.\n\nWe recommend this place to anyone visiting The City.\n\nYou don't have to, but I recommend you dress nicely. This restaurant deserves the best customers for providing the best food and service.",

We got the $85 course, which despite being in Manhattan was surprisingly affordable, and the fish was just so fresh and melts straight into your mouth. The staff were very friendly especially the chefs, and the interior was super cozy. This place is definitely a must try for anyone having their first omakase experience! (Note that you might want to make a reservation beforehand, as they are busy most of the time).",

When I first tried their bird’s nest, I was laughing at how comical the dish was but it was so unique and delicious I ordered it again! I would recommend trying the sake as well, they have the best options. My favorite part about the resturant is they have the cutest collection of chopstick stands and everytime you go you don’t know which one you get! I got a chinese cat last time. Definitely a unique spot that everyone should go to once in their life. I always come here for my birthdays or special occasions. Can’t recommend this place enough.",

The place is nice and humble, and the owner or manager was extremely kind and attentive. All three of us got the lobster risotto. The lobster risotto was this nice risotto where the lobster was incorporated into every bite, along with other components-they all made sense in the dish. The grana padano was an incredibly tasty cheese that I put on my spinach. We also got a few appetizers like the calamari and the prosciutto and they were refreshing. It is not recommended to put cheese on seafood, as the cheese overpowers the seafood. This is my second time going to this place, and yet again, I wasn’t disappointed.",

We had the Fritto misto (calamari) appetizer and the Caesar salad to start - the salad was amazing quite honestly! The gluten free croutons were the best (I usually am never able to get croutons with salad!). For the main meal we had the pollo bacon risotto and the spinaci asiago pasta. The risotto - fantastic! The pasta was good but please allow the server to add cheese to it! I asked them to skimp on the cheese and I needed to add salt to it which was my mistake. When the server came back I asked them to put the normal amount of cheese on it and that fixed it. For dessert we had the special which was the raspberry chocolate tart.... OMG.... Phenomenal!!!

Dessert was great too.\n\nWhat made the experience subpar was the service. We sat outside and ordered a bottle of wine, but bugs started to fall into our wine glasses that we barely drank so we let our server know. She was kind about it and even offered to seat us inside without us asking, which we were surprised about and took her upon her offer. However, once we were seated inside, the entire experience went downhill. We hadn't finished all of our food from outside, and they said they would take care of moving everything inside but they only brought in our appetizers and tossed our half eaten bread which we were hoping to finish. Our new wine glasses were filled with the remainder of the bottle of wine we ordered and we had to ask about the two glasses of wine that were taken from us due to bugs being in them (eventually someone came and refilled our glasses but I wish we didn't need to ask). We also waited 30-45 minutes before dessert was served and it only came because we had to ask for it.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the restaurant for food but wouldn't recommend it for the service. Given its price point and reputation, my friends and I were all very disappointed and it definitely put a damper on our night and celebration. We appreciated the staff trying to improve our experience initially but we would've much rather stayed outside had we known this was the experience we were going to receive.",

The cocktails were outstanding, with playful names inspired by music icons—one after my favorite Beyoncé track, Alien Superstar, and another, Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, honoring the infectious Selena hit. Each drink was superb, with a subtly botanical character that felt especially fitting given the restaurant’s proximity to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\n\nFor brunch, I enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros and the French toast. The Huevos Rancheros featured perfectly cooked short rib, which proved to be the highlight of the dish. The French toast struck a harmonious balance between sweet and savory; fresh blueberries and raspberries, paired with a delicate caramel drizzle, eliminated any need for syrup.\n\nI also sampled the shrimp and grits, which were equally impressive. Even before tasting the shrimp itself, the rich flavor of the seafood infused the grits beautifully.

And the Roasted Hen of the Woods mushroom dish.  Everything was beautiful, balanced, had a lot of mmmmmmm going on.\nAlso, super cute journals carried the check to the table, with comments and drawings.  Very fun.\nWe would def go back again.",

The Happy Hour menu offers a well rounded variety of bites and more hearty items. The Salmon tartare and the Hamachi on crispy rice were standouts and my companions enjoyed the burgers which were also solid. Great atmosphere and wonderful service. I look forward to coming back and trying their dinner menu. The toffee pudding was tasty, but be advised it’s less dense and more airy than a traditional pudding.",

You can tell they are really proud of their daily homemade tofu.\n\nThe first one was cooked 3 layers pork with sides of kimchi, jalapeno, garlic, and soybean paste sauce. It was so delicious. The pork was cooked perfectly. It was soft with nice bouncy texture. It pairs very well with the soybean paste sauce. I basically licked the saucer clean.\n\nThe tofu stew was also very nice. The broth was umami and spicy. The tofu was superb. Rich and elegant of natural soybean flavors. The server informed me that the broth was seafood based. The white noodles were a plus to the dish.\n\nAll the side dishes were so delicious. I think I asked refills for 3 times. Today I got stew potatoes and radishes, cold string beans with garlic, eggplant with mushrooms, pickled radishes, and a cold seaweed dish. My favorites were the eggplant and the string beans. The potatoes had nice flavor, too. I believe I tasted something like miso.\n\nThe servers were attentive and friendly. Even though they were all so busy, they still take time to make sure my needs were met. Overall, I had a great time dining here. I’ll definitely come back with more people. The portions of the foods were great. PLEASE SHARE THE TOFU STEW. I was almost too full to walk after I finished all my foods.",

After we finished our meals, our waiter poured some tea into our rice bowls and served it to us, explaining that it helps with digestion.

We got seated at 5:10pm. One person received their food around 6pm (she ate by herself). The 4 of us got our food at 6:36pm. OVER AN HOUR LATER. We were told that the one person at our table got their food first because they thought it was a single order.  The waitress apologized but did not ask if we wanted to talk to the manager.  So one of our guest asked the waitress if we can get a 10% discount due to the long wait. That’s when the waitress said we need to talk to the manager.  The manager came and gave us 10% off.  Also, the waitress never brought out the dessert until we asked for it (comes with the meal.)  the sweet potato pie came out cold. HOWEVER, the food was really, really good. The greens were delicious, cornbread delicious. the cornbread stuffing was delicious. Yams, mac and cheese, Turkey… delicious. Our desserts—  came at the end and we took it to go.  We also saw another waitress with a visible irritated face. But we take it as she didn't want to work on Thanksgiving. Next time— she should take the day off.\n\nBut Would I go back. Absolutely!

First the portions in the menu were not as stated for the French toast the menu stated 3 slices and we got 2 on both orders. The pancakes tasted as if they were overcooked in oil and the French toast was soggy as left in the egg batter far too long and the eggs my other family member got were dry and disgusting. I am very upset not just with the food but also not once was it stated there would be a forced group charge of 20% ontop of being served this horrible food then to add complete insult to injury they charged me an additional 10 dollar tip when I clearly wrote 0 for additional tip. I cannot believe they are still in business like this. I have never in my 40 years of existence have I ever had experienced such a horrible breakfast from anywhere!!!!! I also paid 65.15  for this experience with 10 dollars being staight stolen from me. You have been warned.",

    "text": "From the lay-out of its website to the layout of its Lexington Ave. restaurant interior, Le Botaniste creates warm and inviting digital and real-life environments that reflect its emphasis on interconnected sustainability. On the website the company is open and transparent, from the philosophic values of its founders to the caloric count of its dishes. And when you walk into the restaurant, the space invites you in down a wide set of rounded stairs onto a black & white patterned floor with warm wooden cabinets and panels rising from it and boasting detailed carvings and scrollwork. Large, colorful pots sit on warmers next to tins of fresh fixings for grain bowls and salads, and the serving staff is extremely friendly and enthusiastic. My wife and I appreciated that we didn’t need to ask what was strictly plant based and what was gluten-free, since everything is! It was easy to place our order and the food was served quickly. The dining area is relaxing and inviting; my wife and I sat in the back section bound by white, brick walls and potted plants, and lit by a ceiling of skylights. Given all the positives mentioned above, I thought the food could have been better. The squash soup and the tomato sauce in the Spicy Chili Sin Carne each tasted like it came from a jar and, although it can be subjective, I felt the chili wasn’t at all spicy. The ingredients were fresh, but they just didn’t come together in a cohesive, flavorful way. I thought the same of the veggie balls, which lacked a definitive flavor. The chocolate pecan cookie was a little too sweet for me, and the omega 3 brownie a little too dry, although I did like the taste. Once Le Botaniste dials in its dish recipes, it will be firing on all cylinders!",

The atmosphere is relaxed but polished, making it an easy place to enjoy a long, satisfying meal without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.\n\nOne thing I strongly recommend is choosing the wine pairing. Each course comes with a different wine selected specifically to match the flavors of the dish, and they absolutely nail it. The pairings elevate the food instead of overpowering it. You can tell the team put real effort into curating drinks that enhance the entire dining experience. If you’re coming here, don’t skip that option — it’s worth it.\n\nThe service was outstanding. The staff were attentive, warm, and genuinely enthusiastic about what they were serving. Dirt Candy is a no-tip restaurant, which I respect, but my server took such good care of me that I felt compelled to insist on giving her something extra. It took a bit of convincing, but she eventually accepted it with a big smile, and I could tell it truly made her day.

    "text": "I booked a table at the Serendipity 3 Upper East Side restaurant for dinner on my wife's actual 60th birthday this evening as we really enjoyed our last visit there 10 years ago for her 50th birthday.\nAlthough we arrived 20 minutes earlier than our 5:15pm slot that I'd booked online, we were shown to a table within a few minutes. There's very little space between tables in the very small & cramped restaurant, so don't expect any privacy as we could clearly hear and follow the conversations of the diners on both the tables either side of us.\nOur super friendly server Randy asked if we were at the restaurant for any special occasion and my wife told him it was her 60th birthday without realising I'd already put all this in the 'what's the occassion?' section of their online booking form. He also asked if we had any allergies, which again I had already said we had none in the 'Any allergies or restrictions?' section of their online booking form. So clearly the servers don't see or don't bother to read the information provided online by their customers, rendering it a complete waste of our time!!!\nThe birthday girl had the American cheeseburger with fries, which was OK. I had the Grandma Holt's fried chicken sandwich with a pot of tea. The fried chicken was a bit dry, the bun was a bit stale and I found the fries to be a bit too salty. My wife was really looking forward to the superb peanut butter cheesecake dessert we enjoyed sooo much on our last visit. However, it was no longer on the menu so she had to settle for the Ultimate Creme Cheesecake, which came with side servings of hot fudge & strawberry sauce.\nOur fabulous server Randy put a candle on the top of my wife's cheesecake, lit it and encouraged everyone in the restaurant to sing happy birthday, which made her feel special. Whilst we were dining in the restaurant there were 4 other people celebrating their birthdays as well.\nThere's a photographer at the restaurant now, who went around every table taking photographs of customers and returning later trying to sell commemorative prints, which I found a bit tacky and touristy - not something I'd expect at a high end restaurant.\nThe decor in the restaurant looked very tired and we certainly didn't enjoy our meal there this time, compared to our exceptional experience 10 years ago. I feel sadly it's more of a tourist trap now, feeding off the embers of its former glory days, which have long gone. We didn't have any alcoholic drinks with our meal and I left feeling the $100 we spent there could have been better spent in one of the hundreds of exceptional restaurants in NYC for the special occasion of my wife's 60th birthday.",

My husband and I and our 2 girls (ages 6 & 9) loved all our food and desserts! My husband got a bacon cheese hot dog and I got the truffle burger. Both amazing. We all had more fries than we could eat. We also got the frozen hot chocolate to share, and each daughter got 1 scoop of ice cream with a topping, which was also more than they could eat. Despite it being packed and needing a reservation, our food came out super quickly. I was really impressed by that. And our waiter, Leo, was SO friendly, which made the overall vibe amazing.

Beetlejuice was incredible! All performers had charm, wit and were highly entertaining.\n\nThe service was great! We were greeted at the door and were asked to wait about 15 mins for a table (we didn’t get to reserve; and we went after 8pm). We were entertained by Beetlejuice outside and he gave us great laughs. We only waited about 5 mins til a table was free.\nOur drink of choice was the Big Fish bowl, delicious! We had the Mac n cheese and lalaurie fries which both delicious! We both got the Sweeney Todd filet mignon and it was great. For dessert we got the death by chocolate and Emily’s wedding cake. Portions are medium to small but filling.\n\nIt’s a bit pricey but gratuity is included and the performers put on a great show. They love taking pictures with you as well.\n\nWe had a blast!

It is a unique, fantastic, creative place and a tribute to New York and something that everyone should experience at least once. It is so hard to run a successful restaurant in New York City, especially through Covid, so it is speaks a lot as to what kind of place this is. If you were a beetle fan or even if you were not, this is a place you must visit in the village. The food is phenomenal, especially the steak and the drinks are even better. Small children would enjoy it if they’ve watched Beetlejuice and like the characters. So highly recommend. For NYC, the reasonable Price Fix menu is a treat.",

    "text": "This is such a hard review to leave because we are also restauranteurs.\n\nMy wife and I wanted some nice hearty salads for lunch so we looked up a few places. We ordered two salads (the mango salad and the arugula, mango, duck walnut, goat cheese salad—never had there been a more literal name for a salad which is fine—just hard to order on the phone).\n\nWe were told these two salads were going to be 35 minutes. Even during a busy rush (which would seem strange at 2:05), two salads shouldn’t take 35 minutes.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that the Arugala Duck Salad (for short) is described as tradition “New Orleans” style salad. We lived in New Orleans for 4 years and ate all over the city. It’s a culinary mecca. This is not close to anything traditional to New Orleans.\n\nThe salad was quite small for a $21 salad. Two salads totaled $56 which we don’t mind paying based on the food description. I’m in the food and beverage industry so I know the cost of goods. This was literally two handfuls of Arugal, some cubed mangos, a blob of coated goat cheese, and waaaay overcooked tiny slivers of duck breast. I understand the rising cost of business in this industry, but I could never to this to my patrons.\n\nThe duck was embarrassingly bad and the beef on my wife’s salad was so overcooked, it was almost inedible. The duck breast slivers were not only small and overcooked but rubbery. That’s strange because the fat wasn’t rendered properly so the skin was gelatinous and chewy so it being overcook was just a lack of care or  lack of training for the cook who cooked the duck breast. The packaging was so half hearted for $56 for two salads.\n\nThis was rough. I’d be willing to adjust my review with a response from the owners. But, as far as first impressions go, we won’t order again based off this experience.\n\nSo unfortunate in flavor and overpriced for the result.",

I would give their cheese pizza a 3 star, as the sauce or cheese needs a kick but the 3 Cheese Chipotle Chicken pizza was a 4.5 star, as the crust and toppings were in perfect harmony. This place is worth a visit if you love pizza. The staff was very friendly too.",

The service is great, I was helped almost immediately, even though it was lunch time and very busy in the place. I ordered the daily special (it was a wrap with corned beef, Russian sauce, lettuce, tomato, banana peppers and Swiss cheese). It blew me away! For under $9, I got a wrap packed with meat and veggies and cheese! I can confidently say that it’s one of the best sandwiches I have ever had! Everything just works together so well! I would strongly suggest this place for anyone looking for a hearty meal on the cheap!",

Completely flat and tastes like it came out of a dirty gun.\n\nHOWEVER every time I come here I get the chicken platter, Mac and cheese, and a tuna melt. The chicken is succulent with a beautiful breading and is piping hot every time. It is served with a sweet honey butter that goes beautifully with the biscuits as well. The biscuits are good but not mind blowing, they are small and served 3 per order. The Mac and cheese can be dry depending on the batch but this most recent visit was perfectly creamy but still firm enough to slice. It is a baked style. The tuna melt is one of my favorites in the city. It has a massive amount of tuna inside but feels lighter than others I have had. It almost takes like the tuna is whipped. I can’t figure out what they do to the tuna but it’s great. The best part about this place is that the kitchen is open late. We actually came this time because the restaurant we were trying to go to had closed their kitchen early. It’s really great having this option in the area.",

A Rob recommendation is literal pixie dust.\n\nI entered 8 minutes before our scheduled time because my pops always told me \"if you're on time, you're late.\" I entered and saw a 6'2 burly figure with a worn in nike hat and legendary beard sipping on a Negroni, and realized Rob beat me here. Damn... Negroni on a Monday is so beast though.\n\nWe got a little booth in the corner, and I decided to hop on the Negroni train. I normally don't drink during the week, but sometimes the Negroni gods just force your hand. My nickname in college was actually \"Post Negrone.\"\n\nRob informed me that the hot chicken sandwich ($19) was the move, which checked out with my research from before dinner.\n\nI never really stop and smell the roses, as comfort is the enemy of progress, but sitting in this dimly lit dive bar sipping negronis with one of the best food creators on the internet, and someone I really look up to, forced me to have a moment of appreciation.\n\nBetween bites of one of the best crispy chicken sandwiches I have ever had in my life, we were talking about writing, editing, our favorite restaurants, youtube thumbnails, algorithms, favorite authors, upcoming shoot schedules, and lofty long term goals that really had me pinching myself. Like damn I'm really doing this, you know? I felt like I was living someone else's life, not mine. I didn't even really know this was possible.\n\nWe deleted these chicken sandwiches, chips and queso, and 2 rounds of negronis as the table next to us turned 2 different times. What a night, provided by an iconic ambiance, sensational chicken sandwiches, and my old friend, the negroni.\n\nIG @johnny.novo\nTiktok @jnov__\nSubstack @johnnynovo",

Debated for a bit and ultimately decided to stay because I’ll not be denied of my chicken sandwich lol.\n\nStarted off with the Orange Julio, as if it’s the grownup Orange Julius. Two sips in and immediate brain freeze. The vibe is a bit chaotic but the bartenders did a great job making sure everyone is well-hydrated with drinks. Shortly before 5pm, my bartender gave me the food menu as if she could read my mind.\n\nI got the mild breast sandwich and a small side of fries. The sandwich came out piping hot and prolly the juiciest chicken breast I’ve ever eaten. Could it be a wet brine process..? However, the chicken was a tad too salty for my taste. Still, I inhaled the sandwich. The fries were okay..? Nothing special but an adequate companion to my sandwich.\n\nAll in all, I was a very happy camper. I love the Commodore and I’ll be back for sure!",

I wish it was a little more moist, but the ice cream kinda helped that aspect. We also tried one of each of the empanadas. The kale one was the best and the caprese one threw me off because the filling was cold. It was all still very good, but room for little improvements.\nService- Appropriate length of time of time for each dish; dessert came really fast.

We've had 3 different servers and, for a newly opened restaurant in 2022 they were all attentive and knowledgeable... that is hard to come by for any restaurant new or old!\n\nI must say I am a fan of anything blue and there is plenty of blue lighting, accents and décor throughout but it is balanced by other textures and tones. There is a baby grand piano on the far end for the lounge/bar area. We haven't sat in the main dining room yet because the lounge is just too cool.\n\nWe've had the steak au poivre, stout braised pork chop and  prime rib entrees. For appetizers we have had the bao buns, smoked salmon that also comes with a tasty deviled egg. There is a bar/lounge menu and from that we've had the fried chicken, tuna tacos and pulled pork nachos. So, everything has been outstanding! The chef and his team are already in a grove.\n\nWhen we've gone it was on the weekend and the place was pretty much full but I don't think you'd have to wait long for a seat because they have a lot of options between the bar, lounge and dining room. From what I've experienced so far the future looks bright (and blue) for Storm King Lounge and Fare.",

Also the Croquetas de Setas were amazing and the Montado de Bistec y Chorizo was perfection.

It also didn’t help that we were seated close to the bathroom, so people were going back and forth by our table the whole time 😅\nI saw they had a “famous” crunchy french toast, that included crushed corn flakes and slivered almonds. Thank god I ordered it with the homemade blueberry compote, because the toast was bizarrely flavorless, not even maple syrup saved it. I also thought the corn flakes and almonds would be crumbled on top, but instead it comes “battered” in that, creating a weird texture.

Every time I come here, I’m blown away by the quality of the food, the staff’s service, and the cozy atmosphere of the restaurant — it’s a solid 10000/10 every time.\n\nWith the chilly weather, I was craving DAESUN soju and seafood like in Busan, and this place turned out to be the perfect choice.\n\nWe had assorted Mak-hwe, mackerel, and scallop gimbap topped with uni and sweet shrimp. The rice is the most important part of Gimbap — and theirs is unbelievably good! The accompanying ssamjang and mayo sauces were just fantastic.\n\nAt one point, my friend accidentally dropped a spoon, and the staff immediately replaced it with a new one — even bringing over a Tide stain remover stick just in case it got on her clothes. Their attentiveness and kindness were truly impressive...🥹\nWe ended the meal with Dolsot Al-Bap and Hap-Cheon Pork Soup the perfect pairing with soju that just went down so smoothly.\n\nMy friends who were visiting said they were so touched by the taste and service that they almost cried.\n\nAriari is one of those rare spots in New York that never fails to make me happy. The food is amazing, complemented by the warm hospitality that’s rare to find in New York!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️\n\nWriting this review is making me crave it again — I think I’ll go back this week. Now that it’s getting cold, it’s the perfect time to visit Ariari. Highly, highly recommend!",

Their staff stare at you for asking for soy sauce and hot sauce as if you’re stealing it and then they only give you 1 of each for an order of 4 items, what a joke! I’m disappointed because having lived in NYC, Korean food was much better in this area.",

From start to finish, the experience exceeded expectations.\n\nOur server Lena was a darling:  attentive, warm, and made sure everything was perfect. We started with the jumbo lump crab cake and salad, which was fresh and flavorful. My friend had the cashew-crusted salmon (he swapped the potatoes for asparagus,  great choice!), and I had the pan-roasted branzino, cooked to perfection. The blackberry nojito seltzer was a hit! We ended the evening with a chocolate brownie and vanilla ice cream that was the perfect sweet touch.\n\nDespite the buzz of the city around us, the atmosphere felt calm and intimate.   A little oasis right in the heart of it all. I guess when you have an amazing date and great food, nothing else really matters 😊\n\nHighly recommend and can’t wait to return!",

I pointed out that’s not a Tom Collins, it’s a different drink, which I would have ordered had I wanted that. He said he’s not from the 1900s, and I passed him my drink and asked him not to make me another. At that point I didn’t want a drink from someone who’s such a jerk.

The place was not busy and we got an amazing window seat and got straight to ordering which included Kow Soy ($17.95), Vegetable Curry ($17.95) and, Curry Rice ($2.50) - a side portion which was enough to feed our little one!\n\nFood overall was inline with expectations; nothing spectacular, but not disappoint either. Not much spice kick, but the Kow Soy was packed with flavor and the Vegetable Curry, not so much! Decent portion sizes too.\n\nService was slightly slow, but food arrived within 25-mins of ordering.

And it was beautifully plated, the salmon was perfectly cooked tender and flaky, flavor on point, and just ask around perfection. I also ordered a pomegranate ginger ale and it was alright. Not that good. Too much sugar but the curry was bomb.\nTried my friend's curry as well and it also slapped. So good!",

    "text": "For many people this will be FIVE STARS. I want to make that really clear because if you like a thick cut fry that’s golden on the outside with a high “fuffly potato” ratio on the inside, you’ll enjoy it thoroughly because they’ve executed amazingly on that kind of fry. The problem in this case is me: I like a thin cut fry with more of the crunchy / crispy golden exterior and less of the interior of a fry. And they really are two different categories of fry. As far as execution on the former is concerned, it’s done well. I just don’t like that kind of fry. The black truffle mayo we got sounded great but fell very short of our expectations. Barely any truffle flavour and you have to buy truffle oil separately. The place does feel like a rendezvous for Diagon Alley’s shadiest wizards so that’s actually really cool especially because it feels like you’ve entered an olden times tavern restaurant in 18th century England. All in all if you like the thick cut fry scene they guys have executed beautifully, but if you’re like me I wouldn’t choose to come back here simply because of my preference for cut fries. I’m sure these guys would do an amazing job making those.",

    "text": "I have been running a traditional Belgian frituur “Oma’s Frit” for 15 years 🇧🇪. I walked in here out of pure curiosity, because Belgian fries are not just food — they’re a network of tradition and perfection, built over generations.\nThe secret to real Belgian fries lies in the quality and variety of the potatoes, the type of fat used, and precise control of temperature and frying time. Even how many potatoes are added to the fryer at once makes a difference: if you add too many, the temperature suddenly drops, which immediately affects the texture.\nA powerful fryer, the right fat, and especially the double-frying method with correct temperatures and timings are absolutely crucial.\nIn Belgium, potatoes are delivered fresh every day, and we mostly use Bintje potatoes because of their unique flavor and structure. Occasionally we switch to Agria, but nothing truly compares to good Bintjes.\nWith all that in mind, I was curious to give this place a try. I walked in… and honestly, I walked back out rather quickly. The bar for fries in Belgium is simply very high, and what I saw here didn’t reach that level.\n\nThis is not meant as negative criticism, just an honest observation: real fries… that’s something truly Belgian. 🇧🇪🍟",

Lupe’s isn’t just a place; it’s where our love grew, from dating to marriage. I’ll never forget how, when my husband was still my boyfriend, he’d always stop by before seeing me to grab a margarita. Three years later, it’s still his favorite bar,his ritual. After work, you’ll find him here, greeted by the kindest bartenders who treat him like family (and pour the most generous drinks). and of course the margaritas are the best in town!!! Period❤️❤️❤️\n\nThe corner spot, with its neon glow and lantern style lighting, feels like a secret hideaway romantic, cozy, and alive with energy. Summer nights on the patio under those red lights just so magic!\n\nWe’ve ordered takeout many times, but tonight we sat at my favorite corner table outside and had a proper feast: the vibrant shrimp salad, crispy fish tacos, tender beef tacos, and the most perfectly cooked fish plate. And the flan? Hands down the best, tortillas are so yummy 🤤 😋 and authentic, the taste just can bring you back to Mexico! Portions are generous, flavors are bright, and everything tastes impossibly fresh, no surprise, since the entire kitchen team is from Mexico.\n\nBut what makes Lupe’s special isn’t just the food or drinks，it’s the people. The staff radiates warmth, making every visit feel like coming home. You can always find the owner inside and make sure every dish and drink is perfect, so friendly to the customers. Lupe’s is the institution ❤️ Funny enough, if I ever can’t reach my husband? I know exactly where he’ll be: at Lupe’s, drink in hand, happy or (occasionally) mad at me. It’s his sanctuary.\n\nTo the team: Thank you for being part of our story. Here’s to many more years of tacos, margaritas, and memories. If you love Mexican food, Soho charm, or just feeling like family, Lupe’s is your spot. It’s not just a restaurant—it’s a piece of our hearts.",

I recently went there and was thoroughly impressed, especially by their take on comfort food classics.\n\nMy friends and I were craving something hearty, and we were not disappointed. We ordered a big chicken sandwich and a juicy burger to share, and both were outstanding. The chicken sandwich was a true showstopper—perfectly fried to a golden crisp while remaining incredibly moist and tender on the inside. It was a generous size and had a fantastic, flavorful crunch with every bite. The burger was equally impressive. It was cooked to a perfect medium, with a patty so juicy and rich that it practically melted in your mouth. The classic toppings and a toasted bun made for a flawless burger experience.\n\nWhat made the meal even better were the sides and drinks. The fries were a perfect companion, hot and crispy, and just the right amount of salt. And the cocktails were excellent. We each had a few different ones, and they were all expertly mixed and well-balanced—they weren't just an afterthought but a highlight of the meal. The entire place has a warm and inviting vibe, and the staff was friendly and attentive. For a spot that feels like a cozy neighborhood tavern but serves up incredible, elevated pub fare and great drinks, Dorlan's is a definite winner.",

Everyone is so friendly and respectful. During Ramadan, they even asked if we were fasting and kindly brought us dates and water as a compliment — such a thoughtful gesture! When it was time to eat, they brought our food right away.\n\nWhat’s also great is the variety — it’s not only food from Muslim countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, but also Russian and Ukrainian dishes. There’s something for everyone, so you can always find something you’ll love.\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy, the food is perfect, and the whole experience is always wonderful. Nargis Cafe truly feels like our go-to spot. Highly recommend! ❤️",

We’ve had Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, & Turkish food many times in the past but this is the first time we had Uzbek cuisine. There are some similarities or cross influences I assume, but the food was unique & delicious in its own rights.  We had lunch & loved the food (see pictures of what we had & descriptions) we ordered and would definitely come back for more!  The atmosphere & ambience was beautiful & clean.  The service was very good—the staff were polite & helpful.  No complaints overall.  Only reasons I didn’t give it 5 stars were minor—our water glasses were not refilled & staff didn’t come by to check if anything was needed as hoped.  Something minor but could be improved to make an excellent overall experience.  Here’s my TA$TE ratings of Nargis:\n\nTaste:5 stars/delicious\nAmbience: 5 stars/beautiful & clean\n$: 5 stars/very reasonable\nTreatment: 4stars/service was very good but can improve on attentiveness\nExperience: 5 stars/overall experience was great & would definitely come back!",

We were looking for a more intimate and casual setting rather than a more formal wedding in a reception hall and we fell in love with the food and the place going for dinner one night. Service was great on the night of and communication beforehand was top notch. Meryl was incredibly helpful with the logistics and provided not only reccomendations on vendors but also how to optimize the space (due to our large guest count). They were receptive to our thoughts and ideas of how we wanted the night to go and how it would fit with their space. They also lent us a projector to play a game and provided some of the decor (small candles, lanterns, and hanging linens). Overall they’re a well-oiled machine with the best food (3 course plated meal) — they’re a restaurant after all! 100% would reccomend duck confit. Our wedding coordinator said that we were given a very good price for the superb level and quality of service that was included. Overall, the staff are lovely and shows how passionate they are about making our big day wonderful -- would rate this a 100 out of 10 experience.\n\nRegardless if you’re looking to have your wedding here or not — 100% you should come here in a regular day have dinner here!!! My husband and I sometimes just drop by to eat (p.s. don’t think about it and just get the bread and butter). Super accessible by train! :) We come all the way from Flushing -- that's how yummy their food is :P",

It really felt like we were sharing a meal that was crafted with love and intention, which made it even more meaningful for us.\n\nWhat stood out the most was the way the staff handled everything with such calm professionalism while still being kind and personal.

Inside, the bar and dining area gave off that cozy, timeless feel you only really get from a true restaurant venue.\n\nThe staff was fantastic, organized, welcoming, and clearly experienced with events. And the food? Genuinely incredible. It's something we always notice when weddings are hosted at restaurants instead of traditional venues: the quality and consistency of the food are just on another level.\n\nThe guest count was around 150, and it felt like the perfect number for the space, everyone was comfortable, and nothing felt overcrowded.\n\nA really special spot for couples who want a celebration that feels personal, elegant, and food-focused.

Their food and drinks are truly incredible, change seasonally, and will always leave you dreaming for the next time you can return.\n\nWe have a special place in our hearts for Bacchus.

The Flaming Peking Duck is a true standout, not only for the impressive presentation but for the quality and taste that fully deliver. Paired with scallions, cucumber, and soft pancakes, it captures everything I love about authentic Peking duck.\n\nThe menu blends Asian and Latin flavors in such a creative way, making every dish feel bold and unique. I also loved the duck bone soup that comes with the meal; it’s comforting, flavorful, and the perfect complement to the duck. You can choose half Peking duck and half smoked duck or go for the full Peking duck which I definitely recommend.\n\nIf you’re a duck lover, Golden Wuish should be at the top of your list. The food, flavors, and overall experience truly make it worth the visit.",

Upon entry, I noticed a cozy enclosed outdoor seating area, followed by a few steps up to the main entrance. Evening street parking was a breeze. Famished, we sat toward the back and commenced with two appetizers: guacamole with hearty tortillas chips (they don’t break when you scoop up the guacamole), and Choriqueso (melted cheese, chorizo, Picolo de gallo, guacamole, flour tortillas), I wasn’t crazy about the salsa, however, the guacamole was very good.\nI decided to try the Toro Narteño (grilled steak, jalapeño, pico de Galli, Monterey cheddar cheese). Which was very tasty, I found the jalapeño to be very fresh and crunchy, and My husband ordered the Enchiladas Suizas (pulled chicken, green salsa, corn tortillas, cheddar cheese, Monterey, Avocado, pickled red onions, rice & black beans). I didn’t like it at all, the tortilla tasted like it was made with all-purpose flour and the chicken was soggy. Rice and beans were ok. Our friend ordered the Burrito Classico (ground beef, shrimp, steak), he liked it. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. His recommendations for desserts that were made on premises were everything on the menu except the ice cream and mexican coffee cake. So we ordered the tres leches and the Mexican coffee cake (because I heard it’s made with mascarpone cheese! So it’s like tiramisù without the coffee). They really aced the Tres Leches. As a side note, if you have a sensitivity to msg, you should let them know because they do use adobo in their cooking.\n\n4 stars are for cleanliness, wait staff, appetizers and dessert.",

The molcajete is great to try a bunch of different things, and it comes with tortillas. The sauce is quite salty and tangy, but still I highly recommend it. They have pretty generous “happy hour” hours, so before 7pm on weekdays you can get a good deal on some drinks!",

It felt a bit pretentious, with prices that seemed inflated for the quality of the food. This could be a decent choice for a special occasion where ambiance is a priority, but for a regular dining experience, it's not worth the cost. With so many incredible dining options in New York, this is likely a \"one and done\" for me. I'd prioritize trying other places before considering a second visit.",

    "text": "Casino restaurant envelops diners in a warm, inviting atmosphere that perfectly sets the stage for an extraordinary meal.\n\nThe Insalata mista is perfect for salad lovers—simple, fresh, and lightly dressed to let the ingredients shine. It’s a refreshing start that feels effortlessly balanced.\n\nThe Heritage chicken is a standout dish that keeps me coming back. Featuring a fragrant ajwain gastrique and a velvety Vidalia onion soubise, this dish is pure perfection. It's so good that I, someone who rarely orders chicken at restaurants, find myself craving it regularly. That alone speaks volumes about its quality.\n\nI’m also endlessly impressed by their Romano Beans, available year-round. Somehow, Casino manages to make this humble ingredient a star in a dish I make a point to enjoy every single visit.",

    "text": "I came here for my friend’s bday dinner. First, food and vibes are really really great. But we were very disappointed by service. Our server James never came to check on us and we couldn’t ask/order things on right time. We also ordered three bottles and when we finally got it we poured our own drinks as nobody came to help us. Also we called ahead to ask for candles as we were celebrating a birthday and he said okay, but he didn’t provide it. We had to ask a manager to get the candles she was very nice and helpful. I would like to come back for food but not for service.",

    "text": "Probably more of a 3.5. Pretty restaurant, upstairs and down. Very active noise level and very close to one another tables. Cocktails were good, appetizers (eggplant faratini, radicchio salad, gulf shrimp) fine. I had the pesto pasta and it was really under seasoned. My friend had the clam pasta. We shared the pavlova for dessert and it was, again, fine. Good not great but an energetic lively vibe. Probably worth a revisit in the future.",

Food was a 3.5 out of 5, can’t say I’ll be coming back for a dinner, but for a drink and atmosphere I would. If I could leave 3.5 stars I’d do that. Overall not a bad experience, however the service could be better.\n\nUpdated: Don’t order the chicken dish.",
